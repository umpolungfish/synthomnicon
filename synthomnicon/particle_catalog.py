Fundamental Particle Synthon Catalog — v0.4.21

Primitive-tuple encodings for Standard Model carriers and the graviton,
derived from the SynthOmnicon framework's K-hierarchy temporal theory
(METAPHYSICS.md §§XXIV–XXVII) and Qwen's independently validated
graviton/Higgs/gauge boson encodings.

Covers 7 entries across two groups:

  Group I  — Force carriers (massless)
             Graviton, Photon, Gluon
  Group II — Force carriers (massive) + symmetry-breaking field
             W_boson, Z_boson, Higgs

Design principles:
  - K_fast is the signature of massless carriers (graviton, photon, gluon)
  - K_trap is the signature of mass-acquired carriers (W, Z after Higgs coupling)
  - K_slow encodes the Higgs frozen vacuum expectation value
  - T_network_sym distinguishes spin-2 (graviton) from spin-1 (photon: T_linear)
  - T_network for gluon encodes colour flux tube confinement (topology, not mass)
  - T_bowtie for Higgs encodes the cyclic EW symmetry-breaking self-coupling loop
  - Φ_c for graviton: GR's non-linear self-coupling (gravitons source curvature)
  - Φ_c for gluon: QCD asymptotic freedom + non-perturbative self-organisation
  - G_aleph (graviton, photon): cosmological reach
  - G_gimel (gluon): confined to hadronic scale (~1 fm)
  - G_beth (W, Z, Higgs): single-particle coupling

See METAPHYSICS.md §XXVII for full structural derivations and §XXVI for
the photon encoding that anchors this catalog.

Recorded 2026-03-21. Qwen validation document: graviton (D_holo, T_braid,
K_fast, Φ_c, Ω_Z) and Higgs (D_wedge, T_bowtie, K_slow, G_local, Φ_c, Ω_0)
incorporated and reconciled with framework primitives. Note: Qwen's T_braid
for the graviton was replaced by T_network_sym — T_braid encodes anyonic
exchange statistics (fractional QHE, Kitaev), not spin-2 metric perturbation
symmetry. T_network_sym (symmetric bcc-like connectivity) is the correct
encoding for the graviton's symmetric rank-2 tensor coupling.

    Graviton — hypothetical spin-2 massless carrier of gravity.

    ⟨D_holo; T_∈(sym); R_†; P_±^sym; F_ℏ; K_fast; G_ℵ; Γ_∨(BROAD); Φ_c⟩

    Structural derivation (METAPHYSICS.md §XXVII.3):

    K_fast: massless — zero K_trap spatial localisation, identical K-hierarchy
    to the photon (K_trap temporal + K_fast). Propagates at c (K_fast ceiling).

    T_network_sym: spin-2 = symmetric rank-2 tensor coupling = couples
    identically in all spatial orientations simultaneously. Diffeomorphism
    invariance of GR = coordinate-independent symmetric connectivity.
    Distinguishes graviton from photon (T_linear, spin-1 vector).

    D_holo: GR exhibits holographic structure — bulk gravitational degrees of
    freedom encoded on the boundary (AdS/CFT, §XVIII). D_holo is the natural
    dimensional encoding for a field that propagates the geometry of space itself.

    G_aleph: universal coupling — graviton couples to all K_trap spatial
    (all mass-energy) at all scales. No selectivity restriction.

    Phi_c: GR is self-referential. Gravitons carry energy-momentum, which is
    itself a source of spacetime curvature. This non-linear self-coupling
    (absent in EM) is the structural origin of the non-linearity of Einstein's
    field equations and the challenge of perturbative quantum gravity.

    Note on Qwen validation: Qwen proposed T_braid for the graviton. T_braid
    encodes anyonic/braided exchange statistics (fractional QHE, non-abelian
    anyons). The graviton's spin-2 symmetry is better captured by T_network_sym.
    Qwen's D_holo and Phi_c are confirmed.

    Prediction: P-59 (c propagation, no dispersion), P-60 (tensorial polarisation
    only — no scalar/vector modes).

    Structural derivation (METAPHYSICS.md §§XXVI.3, XXVII.8):

    K_fast: massless — zero K_trap spatial. But short-range despite masslessness.

    Short range NOT from K_trap mass (like W/Z) but from T_network confinement:
    colour flux tubes (T_network topology) form between colour charges. The T-topology
    itself confines quarks — gluons cannot escape the colour-connected network.
    The range mechanism is T-topological, not kinetic. (§XXVI.3 force range table.)

    T_network: colour flux tubes form networks between quarks in hadrons.
    Gluons themselves carry colour charge — they are part of the T_network they create.

    G_gimel (mesoscale): confined to hadronic scale (~1 fm). Contrast with
    graviton and photon (G_aleph = cosmological reach).

    Phi_c: QCD exhibits asymptotic freedom (coupling → 0 at high energy) and
    confinement (coupling → ∞ at low energy). The transition between these regimes
    involves genuine self-organisation and non-perturbative structure. The
    SU(3) gauge group's non-abelian structure (8 gluons carrying colour) makes
    QCD self-referential in a way QED (abelian U(1)) is not.

    Structural derivation (METAPHYSICS.md §§XXVI.2, XXVII.8):

    K_slow: the Higgs vacuum expectation value (VEV = 246 GeV) is quasi-static
    below the electroweak phase transition temperature (~100 GeV). The Higgs
    field is a frozen landscape — it does not oscillate on particle timescales.
    K_slow = the dominant kinetic character: a frozen high-barrier state
    (the EW symmetry-broken vacuum). K_trap would encode the excitation (Higgs
    boson at 125 GeV); K_slow encodes the VEV substrate.

    T_bowtie: cyclic self-coupling loop. The Higgs mechanism is a self-consistent
    cycle: (1) EW symmetry breaking occurs → (2) W/Z acquire K_trap spatial →
    (3) W/Z couple back to the Higgs to maintain the broken vacuum → (4) the
    broken vacuum maintains the Higgs mass. T_bowtie encodes this cyclic
    back-coupling (the Mexican hat potential's self-referential ground state).

    D_wedge (molecular): couples at the individual particle level.

    G_beth: local coupling — Higgs couples to individual particles via Yukawa terms.
    Does NOT couple to photon (U(1) unbroken) or gluon (SU(3) unbroken).
    SELECTIVE: couples to W, Z, and all massive fermions; not to massless carriers.

    Phi_sub: the low-temperature broken phase is below criticality. The EW phase
    transition itself (T ~ 100 GeV, where EW symmetry breaks) is the Phi_c event.
    Below it, the Higgs VEV is frozen (Phi_sub = post-critical frozen state).

    Note: Qwen proposed Phi_c for the Higgs. This is correct at the EW transition
    but the ground-state Higgs is Phi_sub (frozen condensate). The distinction
    matters: the Higgs *creates* a Phi_c event (symmetry breaking) but *lives* in
    Phi_sub (the broken phase).
