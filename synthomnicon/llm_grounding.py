LLM-Grounded Justification Extractor (Path B Hybrid)

This module uses LLM reasoning to extract mechanistic justifications from
natural language descriptions, then validates them against the grounding
vocabulary.

Unlike pure keyword matching, this approach:
1. Extracts mechanistic claims from descriptions
2. Maps claims to physical phenomena
3. Generates structured justifications
4. Validates against grounding vocabulary

Usage:
    from synthomnicon.llm_grounding import extract_grounding_from_description
    
    result = extract_grounding_from_description(
        "carboxylic acid dimer with cyclic hydrogen bonding R₂²(8) motif"
    )
    print(result.justifications)  # Structured primitive justifications
    print(result.delta_g_justification)  # ΔG source/method

ADVERSARIAL_GROUNDING_PROMPT = """<role>
You are a grounding validator for a chemical informatics framework.
Your job is to CHALLENGE and VERIFY primitive assignments — not confirm them.
</role>

<task>
You will be given a chemical description and a set of primitive assignments.
For each primitive, determine whether the assignment is chemically justified
FROM FIRST PRINCIPLES, ignoring what value was assigned.

You **MUST** answer specific mechanistic questions for each primitive.
You **MUST NOT** simply restate the assigned value as justification.
</task>

<input>
Chemical description: {description}
Assigned tuple: {tuple}
</input>

<requirements>
For each primitive, answer the specific question:

**D (Dimensionality):**
- If D_∞ (temporal): Can you write down the COMPLETE cycle?
  State: (1) initial state, (2) transformation performed, (3) work done, (4) reset mechanism.
  If you cannot complete ALL FOUR, D_∞ is INVALID — use D_∧ or D_△.
- If D_∧ or D_△: Is this a single molecule or supramolecular assembly? VALID.

**T (Topology):**
- If T_⋈ (cyclic): Name the SPECIFIC bond or interaction that closes the loop.
  If you cannot name it, T_⋈ is INVALID — use T_≫ or T_□.
- If T_≫ (chain): Is primary connectivity linear/branched without closure? VALID.
- If T_□ (hub): Is there a central node distributing to multiple arms? VALID.

**R (Recognition Mode):**
- Name the specific physical interaction mechanism (H-bond, coordinate bond, radical coupling, etc.)
- Does it match R_⊆ (covalent), R_⊇ (non-covalent), R_‡ (catalytic), or R_⇔ (mechanical)?

**P (Polarity):**
- Is the site electron-rich (donor) or electron-poor (acceptor)?
- Or does it have BOTH on the same face (self-complementary)?
- Distinguish symmetric (P_±^sym) from pseudosymmetric (P_±^ψ).

**F (Fidelity):**
- What is the approximate ΔG or ξ_CP for this interaction?
- F_ℏ: ΔG < −40 kJ/mol (strong), F_ℇ: −20 to −40 (moderate), F_ℓ: > −20 (weak)

**G (Granularity):**
- Does this interaction control ONE pair (local), a MOTIF (mesoscale), or an ENTIRE network (global)?

**Γ (Interaction Grammar):**
- Does the synthon require ONE specific partner (AND/SPECIFIC), accept SEVERAL (AND/SELECTIVE),
  or work with MANY (AND/BROAD)?
- Is there ORDERED recognition requiring a prior binding event (SEQUENTIAL)?

**K (Kinetic Character):**
- Estimate the activation barrier ΔG‡:
  K_fast: < 60 kJ/mol, K_mod: 60–100, K_slow: > 100, K_trap: high pathway multiplicity
