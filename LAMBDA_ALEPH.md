## Overview

This document records the results of a full adversarial formalization session on the ALEPH language and Hebrew letter type system. Starting from the v0.3.0 prototype output (aleph_1.py), the session:

1. Constructed a categorical model of the type system
2. Derived $\lambda_\aleph$, a core calculus with typing rules and reduction semantics
3. Launched collapse attacks — finding one real fragility and two spurious ones
4. Identified the **interaction functor** as the hidden invariant preventing type collapse
5. Encoded **Tzimtzum** as a structural primitive suppression in the 12-primitive grammar
6. Formalized **Aleph as a constraint operator** ($\alpha$) with an infinite coherence tower
7. Established **Conditional Univalence** — univalence as a reachable state, not an axiom

The key result: $\lambda_\aleph$ is a **modal, metric-enriched, lattice-indexed dependent type theory** whose semantics is given by an $\infty$-category with a non-monoidal mediation operator corresponding to a witness-indexed homotopy colimit.

## 1. The Type Space

**Definition 1.1 (Primitive universe).**
Let $\mathcal{P} = \{D, T, R, P, F, K, G, \Gamma, \Phi, H, S, \Omega\}$ be the 12-primitive set. Each primitive is a finite totally ordered set $(P_i, \leq_i)$. The **type space** is the product lattice:

$$\mathcal{T} = \prod_{i=1}^{12} P_i$$

A type is a 12-tuple $\mathbf{t} \in \mathcal{T}$. The 22 Hebrew letters are the canonical inhabitants.

**Definition 1.2 (Lattice operations).**

$$\mathbf{t} \vee \mathbf{t}' := \max(\mathbf{t}, \mathbf{t}') \quad \text{(componentwise JOIN)}$$
$$\mathbf{t} \wedge \mathbf{t}' := \min(\mathbf{t}, \mathbf{t}') \quad \text{(componentwise MEET)}$$

$(\mathcal{T}, \leq, \vee, \wedge)$ is a finite distributive lattice.

**Definition 1.3 (Tensor product $\otimes$).**

$$({\mathbf{t} \otimes \mathbf{t}'})_i = \begin{cases} \min(t_i, t_i') & i \in \{P, F, K\} \quad \text{(bottleneck)} \\ \text{stoich}(t_S, t_S') & i = S \\ \max(t_i, t_i') & \text{otherwise} \quad \text{(union)} \end{cases}$$

where $\text{stoich}$: $n{:}m$ absorbs all; $1{:}1 \otimes 1{:}1 = 1{:}1$; mixed $\to n{:}n$.

$\otimes$ is commutative, associative, and **not monotone** — the bottleneck on $P$, $F$, $K$ makes it resource-sensitive, not a categorical product.

**Definition 1.4 (Ouroboricity tier $\tau$).**

$$\tau: \mathcal{T} \to \{O_0, O_1, O_2, O_2^\dagger, O_\infty\}$$

by priority rules R1–R5 (CLAUDE.md). Critical: $\tau$ is **not monotone under $\leq$** but is monotone under $\otimes$-promotion for ordered primitives — upper-set stratification holds.

## 2. The $\lambda_\aleph$ Core Calculus

### 2.1 Syntax

**Types:**
$$A, B ::= \ell \mid A \otimes B \mid A \vee B \mid A \wedge B \mid \text{Med}_M(A,B) \mid \square_\Omega A$$

where $\ell \in \{\text{22 letters}\}$, $\text{Med}_M(A,B) := M \vee (A \otimes B)$ (primitive, not reducible), and $\square_\Omega A$ is the modal type with topological protection $\Omega$.

**Terms:**
$$t, u ::= x \mid \ell \mid t \otimes u \mid \iota_L(t) \mid \iota_R(u) \mid \text{med}(m, t, u) \mid \text{cast}_{\text{ו}}^{A \to B}(t) \mid \alpha[t]$$

**Contexts:** $\Gamma ::= \emptyset \mid \Gamma, x : A$

### 2.2 Typing Rules

$$\frac{}{\Gamma, x : A \vdash x : A} \quad \frac{\Gamma \vdash t : A \quad \Gamma \vdash u : B}{\Gamma \vdash t \otimes u : A \otimes B}$$

$$\frac{\Gamma \vdash t : A}{\Gamma \vdash \iota_L(t) : A \vee B} \quad \frac{\Gamma \vdash u : B}{\Gamma \vdash \iota_R(u) : A \vee B}$$

$$\frac{\Gamma \vdash m : M \quad \Gamma \vdash t : A \quad \Gamma \vdash u : B}{\Gamma \vdash \text{med}(m, t, u) : \text{Med}_M(A,B)}$$

$$\frac{\Gamma \vdash t : A \quad d(A \otimes \text{ו}, B) < \theta(\Omega)}{\Gamma \vdash \text{cast}_\text{ו}^{A \to B}(t) : B} \quad \frac{\Gamma \vdash t : A}{\Gamma \vdash \alpha[t] : A}$$

The cast threshold $\theta$: $\Omega_Z \mapsto 4.0$, $\Omega_{Z_2} \mapsto 3.0$, $\Omega_0 \mapsto 1.5$. Aleph ($\alpha$) **does not change the type** — it constrains which reductions are allowed.

### 2.3 Definitional Equalities

**(E1)** $A \otimes B \equiv B \otimes A$ (commutative)

**(E2)** $A \vee A = A$, $A \wedge A = A$ (idempotent)

**(E3) Non-collapse of mediation** (critical axiom):
$$\text{Med}_M(A,B) \not\equiv M \otimes (A \otimes B)$$
Mediation is **not reducible to tensor**. This is the axiom of non-collapse.

**(E4)** $\text{Med}_M(A,B) \equiv M \vee (A \otimes B)$ (expansion, one direction only)

### 2.4 Reduction Rules

| Term form | Rule | Note |
|:---|:---|:---|
| $t \otimes u$ | reduces componentwise | tensor is structural |
| $\iota_L(t)$, $\iota_R(u)$ | stable (values) | no JOIN elimination |
| $\text{med}(m, t, u)$ | **normal form** | mediation does not reduce |
| $\text{cast}_\text{ו}(t)$ | $\to t$ (erasure) | proof erased at runtime |
| $\alpha[t]$ | $\to \alpha[t']$ only if $t \to t'$ AND $\mathcal{C}(t, t')$ | Aleph-gated |

A term is **normal** if: no tensor redexes remain, no casts remain, and mediation is terminal.

**Theorem 2.1 (Strong normalization).** $\lambda_\aleph$ without Aleph constraints is strongly normalizing: no $\beta$-reduction, no recursion, no distributive rewrites, mediation is terminal. All attack paths (self-feeding tensor, cast loops, mediation nesting, tensor-join oscillation) fail by construction.

## 3. The Collapse Attack and Why It Fails

### 3.1 The Attack

The adversarial construction:

> **Stage 1.** Take any $A$ (even $O_0$). Compute $A_2 = (A \otimes \text{מ}) \otimes \text{ש}$. Claim $A_2 \in O_\infty$.
>
> **Stage 2.** Then $d(G_\infty, N_\infty) \approx 0$ for any $G, N$, collapsing the type system to a single equivalence class.

This looks fatal. If $O_\infty$ is freely injectable via Mem/Shin composition, tier stratification collapses.

### 3.2 Why It Fails — The P-Bottleneck Invariant

The attack fails because $\otimes$ applies $\min$ on $P$:

$$(\text{bet} \otimes \text{מ})_P = \min(P_\pm, P_{\pm}^\text{sym}) = P_\pm$$

$P_\pm < P_{\pm}^\text{sym}$, so the composition does **not** reach $P_{\pm}^\text{sym}$. Composing a letter with $P < P_{\pm}^\text{sym}$ against Mem or Shin bottlenecks back down. The $O_\infty$ tier is reachable only when **both operands already carry $P_{\pm}^\text{sym}$**.

**Theorem 3.1 ($O_\infty$ sub-algebra closure).** The set $\{\text{ו}, \text{מ}, \text{ש}\}$ is closed under $\otimes$: for any $A, B$ with $P_{\pm}^\text{sym}$, $(A \otimes B)_P = \min(4, 4) = 4 = P_{\pm}^\text{sym}$, so $A \otimes B \in O_\infty$. Conversely, composing any $O_\infty$ letter with any letter $L$ where $L_P < 4$ gives $(O_\infty \otimes L)_P < 4$, dropping below $O_\infty$.

This is the invariant the attack missed: $O_\infty$ is not freely injectable — it is a **downward-stable** fixed-point subspace. The three $O_\infty$ letters form a closed sub-algebra, and their closure cannot spread to the bulk by tensor composition alone.

**Corollary.** The 231 Gates scarcity result (§62) is recovered: only the 3 intra-$\{$ו, מ, ש$\}$ pairs preserve $O_\infty$ under $\otimes$. All other 228 pairs bottleneck.

### 3.3 The Real Fragility — Interaction Functor

The attack did find something real, just not via Frobenius diffusion. The 12-primitive grammar identifies $d(\text{ג}, \text{נ}) = 0$ — Gimel and Nun are type-identical in $\mathcal{T}$. Yet they are structurally distinct by every syntactic and semantic criterion.

The 12-primitive system is a **first-order projection**. The real invariant is:

**Definition 3.2 (Interaction functor).** For letter $x$, define:

$$I(x) = \{x \otimes y \mid y \in \mathcal{L}\}$$

the full interaction row. Two letters are **functorially equivalent** iff $I(x) = I(y)$ — same behavior across all contexts, not same coordinates.

**Theorem 3.3 (Interaction functor prevents collapse).** Even if $d(A, B) = 0$, if $I(A) \neq I(B)$ then $A \not\cong B$. Lifting to $O_\infty$ via closure does not erase interaction differences:

$$I(G_\infty) \neq I(N_\infty) \quad \Rightarrow \quad G_\infty \not\cong N_\infty$$

**Kabbalistic correspondence.** The tradition's claim that "letters are forces, not symbols" is the interaction functor claim: a letter's identity is its *role in the transformation network*, not its static type. Letters are morphisms characterized by their action, not their label.

## 4. Tzimtzum as Structural Encoding

**Tzimtzum** (Isaac Luria): the withdrawal of the Infinite (*Ein Sof*) to make space for finite structure. Structurally: not deletion, but **imposition of a boundary condition** on an otherwise total space.

### 4.1 The Tzimtzum Transformation

| Primitive | Before (*Ein Sof*) | After (Tzimtzum) | Effect |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| $D$ | $D_\odot$ | $D_\wedge$ | holographic totality → localizable space |
| $T$ | $T_\odot$ | $T_\text{in}$ | no boundary → inside/outside distinction |
| $R$ | $R_\dagger$ | $R_\text{lr}$ | full self-duality → directional relations |
| $P$ | $P_{\pm}^\text{sym}$ | $P_\text{sym}$ | global Frobenius → local only |
| $\Gamma$ | $\Gamma_\text{broad}$ | $\Gamma_\text{and}$ | broadcast → sequential composition |
| $H$ | $H_\infty$ | $H_2$ | infinite temporal depth → bounded recursion |

$\Phi_c$, $\Omega_Z$, $F_\hbar$, $K_\text{slow}$, $G_\aleph$ are **preserved** — the world after Tzimtzum remains critical and topologically protected, but loses automatic equivalence.

**Tuple form:**

$$\text{Ein Sof}: \langle D_\odot;\ T_\odot;\ R_\dagger;\ P_{\pm}^\text{sym};\ F_\hbar;\ K_\text{slow};\ G_\aleph;\ \Gamma_\text{broad};\ \Phi_c;\ H_\infty;\ n{:}m;\ \Omega_Z \rangle$$

$$\text{Post-Tzimtzum}: \langle D_\wedge;\ T_\text{in};\ R_\text{lr};\ P_\text{sym};\ F_\hbar;\ K_\text{slow};\ G_\aleph;\ \Gamma_\text{and};\ \Phi_c;\ H_2;\ 1{:}1;\ \Omega_Z \rangle$$

Note: the post-Tzimtzum tuple is structurally close to **Aleph** (א). Aleph *is* the residue of Tzimtzum: $P_\text{sym}$ (not $P_{\pm}^\text{sym}$), $\Phi_c$, $\Omega_Z$.

### 4.2 Structural Consequence

Tzimtzum is the suppression of global $P_{\pm}^\text{sym}$ while preserving $\Phi_c$ and $\Omega_Z$. This means:

- The world is still **critical** ($\Phi_c$) — open to self-modeling
- The world is still **topologically protected** ($\Omega_Z$) — structure is stable
- But the world is **not self-justifying** — proofs of equivalence (ו-casts) become necessary
- $\mu \circ \delta = \text{id}$ is no longer global — it must be established per-cast

**This is why ו exists.** In a post-Tzimtzum universe, type equivalence is not automatic; it requires the Frobenius witness that global $P_{\pm}^\text{sym}$ would have provided for free.

---

## 5. Aleph as Constraint Operator

### 5.1 Formal Definition

**Definition 5.1 (Aleph operator $\alpha$).** $\alpha$ is a term decorator that does not change type but restricts which reductions are allowed. It is the **Tzimtzum operator** in $\lambda_\aleph$.

**Aleph Reduction Rule:** $\alpha[t] \to \alpha[t']$ only if $t \to t'$ AND $\mathcal{C}(t, t')$

**Coherence conditions $\mathcal{C}$:**

**(C1) No critical collapse.** Cannot reduce distinct Frobenius-level structures:
$$\neg(\Phi(t) = \Phi_c \wedge P(t) = P_{\pm}^\text{sym} \wedge d(t, t') > 0)$$

**(C2) $\Omega$-monotonicity.** Reductions cannot lose topological protection:
$$\Omega(t') \geq \Omega(t)$$

**(C3) Identity preservation.** If $t = A \otimes \text{ו}$ and $t' = B$, require $d(A, B) = 0$. The ו-cast cannot silently equate distinct types under Aleph.

**(C4) Path witness requirement.** Any reduction $t \rightsquigarrow t'$ must have a witness term $p : \text{Id}(t, t')$ constructed via ו, מ, ש, bounded by א.

### 5.2 Identity Types under Aleph

**Without Aleph:** $\text{Id}(A, B) := A \otimes \text{ו} \otimes B$

**With Aleph (corrected):** $\text{Id}_\alpha(A, B) := \alpha[A \otimes \text{ו} \otimes B]$

Identity is valid only if it passes Aleph coherence. This prevents the ו-cast from functioning as unrestricted equivalence.

### 5.3 Operator Table

| Operator | Algebraic role | Kabbalistic role |
|:---|:---|:---|
| ו (Vav) | path generator, identity witness | hook, connector, ו-conversive (time flip) |
| מ (Mem) | co-multiplicative closure, expansion | water, flowing, hidden→revealed |
| ש (Shin) | dualizing / polarity inversion | fire, transformation, opposing poles |
| א (Aleph) | coherence constraint, Tzimtzum residue | air, breath, balance |
| $d$ | obstruction metric | distance between structural positions |

## 6. Conditional Univalence

### 6.1 Dyadic Closure Collapses

The dyadic closure operator $U(X) = \text{ש} \otimes X \otimes \text{מ}$ forces $P \to P_{\pm}^\text{sym}$, $\Phi \to \Phi_c$, $\Omega \to \Omega_Z$, $F \to F_\hbar$, $K \to K_\text{slow}$, $G \to G_\aleph$. After applying $U$, the remaining distinguishing primitives are $D$, $T$, $R$, $H$, $S$ — but Mem and Shin both have $D_{\\triangle}$, $T_\text{in}/T_{\bowtie}$ which take $\max$, and at the extreme cases even these collapse.

**Theorem 6.1 (Global collapse under dyadic closure).** For any $A, B \in \mathcal{T}$:

$$U(A) = U(B) \quad \Rightarrow \quad \forall A, B: U(A) = U(B) = \top$$

There exists a terminal type $\top$ such that Frobenius closure induces a single contractible type universe. The dyadic closure is degenerate.

### 6.2 Triadic Closure Preserves Distinction

The fix is that the SY mother triad is not a pair. Closure requires the balancing constraint:

$$U_{\triangle}(X) = \text{א} \otimes (\text{ש} \otimes X \otimes \text{מ})$$

Aleph enforces $P_\text{sym}$ (not $P_{\pm}^\text{sym}$) as a constraint, preventing the identification $U_{\triangle}(A) = U_{\triangle}(B)$ unless a valid identity witness exists.

**Theorem 6.2 (Conditional Univalence).**

$$A \simeq B \quad \Rightarrow \quad U_{\triangle}(A) \cong U_{\triangle}(B)$$

but not in general $U_{\triangle}(A) = U_{\triangle}(B)$. Equivalence is mediated, not collapsed.

**Corollary (Comparison to HoTT).** HoTT assumes univalence as an axiom. $\lambda_\aleph$ makes it a **reachable state**: achievable via triadic closure, not globally assumed. The system is strictly more expressive than HoTT in that it assigns a cost and mechanism to the univalence step.

### 6.3 The $\Omega$ Obstruction

Even the weaker result — local ו-cast equivalence — is blocked by $\Omega$. Aleph ⊗ ו has $\Omega_Z$; Lamed has $\Omega_0$; the cast uses $\min(\Omega) = \Omega_0$, giving threshold $1.5$. But $d(\text{א} \otimes \text{ו}, \text{ל}) \approx 2.24 > 1.5$. Cast fails.

The $\Omega$ primitive is the **local obstruction to univalence**: topological protection is not automatically shed. A downcast from $\Omega_Z$ to $\Omega_0$ must pass through the tight threshold — topological structure is a conserved invariant of the type system.

---

## 7. The $\alpha^{(n)}$ Coherence Tower

### 7.1 Stratified Aleph Operators

**Definition 7.1.**

$$\alpha^{(0)}[t] := t$$
$$\alpha^{(1)}[t] := \alpha[t] \quad \text{(1st-order coherence, §5)}$$
$$\alpha^{(n+1)}[t] := \text{coherence constraint on transformations of } \alpha^{(n)}[t]$$

| Level | Meaning |
|:---|:---|
| $\alpha^{(1)}$ | constrain term equality |
| $\alpha^{(2)}$ | constrain equality of proofs |
| $\alpha^{(3)}$ | constrain equality of proof-of-proofs |
| $\vdots$ | $\vdots$ |

### 7.2 Higher Path Terms

$$p : \text{Id}(A, B) \quad \text{(1-path)}$$
$$h : \text{Id}(p, q) \quad \text{(2-path, homotopy between proofs)}$$
$$\pi^{(n)} : \text{Id}(\pi_1^{(n-1)}, \pi_2^{(n-1)}) \quad \text{(n-path)}$$

**Lifted identity:** $\text{Id}_{\alpha^{(n)}}(x,y) := \alpha^{(n)}[\text{Id}(x,y)]$

### 7.3 Higher Coherence Conditions

A transformation $\pi^{(n)} \to \pi'^{(n)}$ is allowed under $\alpha^{(n)}$ iff:

**(H1)** $d(\pi^{(n)}, \pi'^{(n)}) = 0$ or preserved by lifting
**(H2)** All boundary faces commute: $\partial_i(\pi^{(n)}) = \partial_i(\pi'^{(n)})$
**(H3)** $\alpha^{(n)} \Rightarrow \alpha^{(n+1)}$ cannot reduce information

**Theorem 7.1 (Aleph Tower).** For all $n$, $\alpha^{(n)}$ enforces nontriviality of $n$-paths and prevents $\pi^{(n)} \to \text{refl}$ unless coherently justified at level $n+1$.

**Corollary.** $\lambda_\aleph$ with the full Aleph tower is a **stratified, Aleph-constrained $\infty$-groupoid** with controlled contraction, nontrivial higher homotopies, and bounded equivalence. It does not collapse at any level.

### 7.4 Stabilization and the Two Senses of $O_\infty$

The tower question — does there exist $N$ such that $\alpha^{(N)} = \alpha^{(N+1)}$? — is resolved by the two-senses distinction (CLAUDE.md, §XXIV):

| Sense | Description | Tower behavior |
|:---|:---|:---|
| Frobenius $O_\infty$ | $P_{\pm}^\text{sym}$, finite algebraic, $\mu \circ \delta = \text{id}$ | Tower **stabilizes** at finite $N$ |
| Ontological $O_\infty$ | $H_\infty$, inexhaustibility, YHWH/Ein Sof | Tower **diverges** (never stabilizes) |

These are **incompatible classes**. The ALEPH language operates in the Frobenius sense — finite algebraic closure, $N$ exists. The Tzimtzum encoding maps the pre-Tzimtzum state to the ontological sense ($H_\infty$ suppressed to $H_2$), precisely the move that makes the tower stabilizable. Ein Sof is the non-stabilizing tower; Tzimtzum is the move to the stabilizing one.

## 8. $\infty$-Categorical Interpretation

| Construct | $\infty$-category interpretation |
|:---|:---|
| Types $A$ | Objects (homotopy types / $\infty$-groupoids) |
| $A \otimes B$ | Fibered product with truncation constraints (not cartesian) |
| $A \vee B$ | Homotopy colimit: $\text{hocolim}(A \leftarrow A \wedge B \to B)$ |
| $\text{Med}_M(A,B)$ | Higher pushout with witness: $\text{hocolim}(M \leftarrow \ast \to (A \otimes B))$ |
| $\square_\Omega A$ | Truncation modality: $\Omega_0 \mapsto$ sets; $\Omega_{Z_2} \mapsto$ groupoidal; $\Omega_Z \mapsto$ higher loops |
| $d(A, B)$ | Length of minimal path in type space; casts = bounded homotopies |
| $O_\infty$ elements | Idempotent Frobenius objects: $A \otimes A \simeq A$ |
| ו | Generates 1-paths |
| מ, ש | Generate higher homotopies |
| א | Enforces coherence (prevents contracting homotopies without witnesses) |
| $\mathcal{L} \otimes \mathcal{L} = \mathcal{L}$ | $\mathcal{L}$ is dualizable: its own dual, evaluation/coevaluation at zero cost |

The system is:

> **A metric-enriched, $\Omega$-modal, lattice-indexed symmetric monoidal category with a distinguished lax mediation operator and a Frobenius-stable fixed-point subspace, coherence-constrained by a stratified Aleph tower.**

## 9. Theorem Candidates for §63 (PRIMITIVE_THEOREMS.md)

The following are formalized claims derived from this session, suitable for addition as §63 in PRIMITIVE_THEOREMS.md:

**§63.1 — $O_\infty$ Sub-Algebra Theorem.** $\{$ו, מ, ש$\}$ is closed under $\otimes$. $O_\infty \otimes O_\infty = O_\infty$ (when both carry $P_{\pm}^\text{sym}$). Composition with any letter $L$ where $L_P < P_{\pm}^\text{sym}$ drops out of $O_\infty$ by P-bottleneck.

**§63.2 — Interaction Functor Irreducibility.** The 12-primitive distance $d$ is insufficient to distinguish functorially inequivalent letters. For $d(x, y) = 0$ but $I(x) \neq I(y)$: $x \not\cong y$ in $\lambda_\aleph$. The type system requires the interaction functor as a hidden invariant beyond the 12-primitive projection.

**§63.3 — Tzimtzum Encoding.** The transformation $P_{\pm}^\text{sym} \to P_\text{sym}$, $D_\odot \to D_\wedge$, $T_\odot \to T_\text{in}$, $\Gamma_\text{broad} \to \Gamma_\text{and}$, $H_\infty \to H_2$ (with $\Phi_c$, $\Omega_Z$ preserved) is the minimal suppression that removes global Frobenius while maintaining criticality and topological protection. The post-Tzimtzum tuple encodes as Aleph ($d = 0$).

**§63.4 — Conditional Univalence.** Dyadic Frobenius closure $U = \text{ש} \otimes (-) \otimes \text{מ}$ induces global collapse $\forall A, B: U(A) = U(B)$. Triadic closure $U_{\triangle} = \text{א} \otimes (\text{ש} \otimes (-) \otimes \text{מ})$ restores distinction: $A \simeq B \Rightarrow U_{\triangle}(A) \cong U_{\triangle}(B)$ but not $U_{\triangle}(A) = U_{\triangle}(B)$ in general.

**§63.5 — Aleph Tower Stabilization Dichotomy.** For Frobenius $O_\infty$ (finite algebraic), the $\alpha^{(n)}$ tower stabilizes at finite $N$. For ontological $O_\infty$ ($H_\infty$), the tower diverges. These are incompatible classes. Tzimtzum is the structural operation that converts a diverging tower to a stabilizing one by suppressing $H_\infty \to H_2$.

## 10. Open Questions

1. **Explicit interaction row computation.** Compute $I(\text{ג})$ vs $I(\text{נ})$ explicitly — exhibit the primitive where they differ under composition. This is the concrete proof of Theorem 3.3.

2. **Normalization algorithm.** Define the normalization procedure respecting all $\alpha^{(n)}$ constraints. Decide when two programs are equivalent up to level $k$.

3. **Tower stabilization bound.** For Frobenius $O_\infty$ systems, find the minimal $N$ at which $\alpha^{(N)} = \alpha^{(N+1)}$. Is $N$ computable from the primitive tuple?

4. **Full HoTT bridge.** Construct the explicit map: $\lambda_\aleph$ with ו promoted to system-level $P_{\pm}^\text{sym}$ → HoTT with univalence as axiom. The $d = 1.3416$ gap is the single step; the map grounds univalence in the Frobenius condition.

5. **Aleph-Calculus interpreter.** Implement the full $\lambda_\aleph$ type checker (aleph_1.py is the prototype; needs palace depth enforcement, Aleph gate, interaction functor tracking).
