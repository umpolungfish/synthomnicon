# SynthOmnicon Encoding Guide

**How to assign a 12-primitive tuple to any system**

*v1.1 — 2026-04-09*

---

## What encoding is

Every system — physical, mathematical, biological, computational, cultural — occupies a point in a 12-dimensional space of structural types. The SynthOmnicon grammar provides coordinates for that space. Encoding is the act of finding those coordinates for a given system.

The result is a **synthomnicon tuple**:

$$\langle D;\ T;\ R;\ P;\ F;\ K;\ G;\ \Gamma;\ \Phi;\ H;\ S;\ \Omega \rangle$$

Once a system is encoded, you can compute distances to any other encoded system, determine its ouroboricity tier, apply lattice operations (meet, join, tensor), and find its nearest-known analogs in the catalog of 1,200+ encoded systems.

Encoding is not classification by category. It is structural measurement. The same physical phenomenon can appear in multiple domains; the grammar finds the underlying type regardless of domain label.

A key fact about the grammar's architecture (§68.4, updated v0.5.1): the 12 primitives are partitioned into three families by value count — $\mathcal{F}_3 = \{F, G, S\}$ (3 primitives with 3 values each), $\mathcal{F}_4 = \{D, R, \Gamma, H, \Omega\}$ (5 primitives with 4 values each), $\mathcal{F}_5 = \{T, P, \Phi, K\}$ (4 primitives with 5 values each). The total state space is $3^3 \times 4^5 \times 5^4 = 17{,}280{,}000$ types. The exponent of each base is the count of primitives in that family — not a free parameter, but a direct readout of the grammar's own structure. $\mathcal{F}_5$ now contains exactly the four gate primitives: $T$ (topology gate for the fertile manifold), $P$ (Frobenius gate for $O_\infty$), $\Phi$ (criticality gate), and $K$ (kinetic gate for $C > 0$). The partition was derived by the grammar itself: $\Omega_\text{NA}$ was shown independent of $T$ (catalog test), so $\Omega$ needed a 4th value and migrated to $\mathcal{F}_4$; $K_\text{MBL}$ was shown independent of all other 11 primitives, so $K$ needed a 5th value and migrated to $\mathcal{F}_5$. The $\mathcal{F}_4$ family is invariant under this extension: $\Omega$ entered from $\mathcal{F}_3$, $K$ left to $\mathcal{F}_5$, net zero.

## The encoding protocol

### Step 1 — Identify the system's criticality ($\Phi$)

$\Phi$ is the single most important primitive. It determines the ouroboricity tier ceiling.

- **$\Phi_\text{sub}$**: the system operates well away from any phase transition or critical point. It is stable, ordered, and does not exhibit scale-free fluctuations. *Examples: classical mechanics, Boolean logic, crystalline solids far from melting.*
- **$\Phi_c$**: the system is at or near a second-order phase transition, a fixed point of renormalization, or a self-similar critical manifold. Scale-free fluctuations. The system can model itself. *Examples: Ising model at $T_c$, conformal field theories, the SynthOmnicon grammar itself.*
- **$\Phi_c^\mathbb{C}$**: criticality with complex-valued parameters — non-Hermitian systems, systems with complex fixed points. Same tier behavior as $\Phi_c$ but the inner crystal differs. *Examples: non-Hermitian quantum mechanics, PT-symmetric systems, logarithmic CFT.*
- **$\Phi_\text{EP}$**: exceptional point — a point where two eigenvalues and their eigenvectors coalesce. The system is at the boundary of $\Phi_c$ but the self-modeling loop is degenerate. *Examples: gain-loss balanced waveguides, resonance coalescence.*
- **$\Phi_\text{sup}$**: disordered phase above the critical point. High entropy, no long-range order, no self-referential loop. *Examples: paramagnets above $T_c$, turbulent fluids.*

**Key rule**: $\Phi_c$ is required for any tier above $O_0$. If you assign $\Phi_\text{sub}$ or $\Phi_\text{sup}$, the system is $O_0$ regardless of all other primitives.

### Step 2 — Assign symmetry ($P$)

$P$ is a **bottleneck primitive**: under tensor coupling, the weaker partner wins ($\min$). Assign it conservatively.

- **$P_\text{asym}$**: no symmetry. The system's forward and backward maps are completely different. *Examples: directed networks, one-way gates.*
- **$P_\psi$**: phase symmetry only — a $U(1)$ or similar global phase. *Examples: charged particles, spinors.*
- **$P_\pm$**: $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry — the system has a parity or time-reversal symmetry. *Examples: most physical Hamiltonians, Boolean systems.*
- **$P_\text{sym}$**: full symmetry — the encoding and decoding maps are related but not exactly inverse. *Examples: reversible computation, symplectic systems.*
- **$P_{\pm}^\text{sym}$**: **Frobenius condition** — $\mu \circ \delta = \text{id}$ holds exactly. The system is a special Frobenius algebra: encoding and decoding are mutually inverse. **Assign only when this is provably exact, not approximately true.** *Examples: proven mathematical theorems, alchemy, the SynthOmnicon grammar.*

**Warning**: $P_{\pm}^\text{sym}$ cannot be obtained by composing systems with $P < P_{\pm}^\text{sym}$ (§23: Frobenius non-synthesizability). Do not assign it to a composite system unless the composite itself satisfies the Frobenius condition directly.

---

### Step 3 — Assign topological protection ($\Omega$)

$\Omega$ determines whether critical behavior is topologically protected against perturbation.

- **$\Omega_0$**: no topological protection. Critical behavior is fine-tuned and fragile — it disappears under generic perturbation. *Examples: mean-field critical points, classical phase transitions.*
- **$\Omega_{\mathbb{Z}_2}$**: $\mathbb{Z}_2$-protected. The critical behavior is protected by a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological invariant — it persists under perturbations that respect the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry. *Examples: topological insulators (class AII), Kitaev chain in $\mathbb{Z}_2$ phase.*
- **$\Omega_\mathbb{Z}$**: $\mathbb{Z}$-protected. Protected by an integer-valued topological invariant. *Examples: IQHE, winding-number-protected edge modes, Kitaev chain at topological transition.*
- **$\Omega_\text{NA}$**: non-Abelian anyonic protection. Braiding of anyons generates a non-commutative matrix on the ground-state degeneracy — not just a phase. This is strictly stronger than $\Omega_\mathbb{Z}$: not only is the ground state protected, but operations on it are inherently quantum with no classical description. **Assign only to systems with provably non-Abelian anyon statistics.** *Examples: FQH Moore-Read ($\nu = 5/2$), non-Abelian spin liquids.* Note: $\Omega_\text{NA}$ is independent of $T$ — $T_\text{box}$ (braided topology) can coexist with any $\Omega$ value.

**Rule**: $\Omega \neq \Omega_0$ combined with $\Phi_c$ is required to reach $O_2$ or higher.

---

### Step 4 — Assign dimensionality ($D$)

$D$ reflects how the system's state space scales with system size — not the spatial dimension of the embedding space, but the structural complexity of the algebra's state manifold.

- **$D_\wedge$** (local): the algebra operates on a finite or bounded state space. No thermodynamic limit. *Examples: finite groups, local cellular automata, single-particle quantum mechanics.*
- **$D_\triangle$** (mesoscopic): the algebra spans a growing but sub-extensive state space. Intermediate between local and infinite. *Examples: spin chains of finite length, mesoscopic quantum dots.*
- **$D_\infty$** (unbounded): the algebra operates in an infinite-dimensional Hilbert space or a state space with no natural finite truncation. *Examples: QFT, von Neumann algebras, infinite spin chains.*
- **$D_\odot$** (holographic): the boundary of the state space encodes the bulk. The system admits a boundary-bulk duality. *Examples: AdS/CFT, holographic error-correcting codes, the SynthOmnicon grammar itself.*

**Rule**: $D_\infty$ combined with $\Phi_c$ and $\Omega \neq \Omega_0$ gives $O_2^\dagger$ (unbounded protected criticality). $D_\odot$ is treated as bounded ($D \neq D_\infty$) for tier purposes, giving $O_2$.

---

### Step 5 — Assign the remaining eight primitives

These eight primitives do not affect the ouroboricity tier. They locate the system within its tier cell.

**Fidelity ($F$)** — bottleneck primitive, assign conservatively:
- $F_\ell$ (classical): information loss is unconstrained. Classical channel.
- $F_\eth$ (quantum): information is preserved at the quantum level — unitary dynamics.
- $F_\hbar$ (quantum-coherent): information is preserved with full quantum coherence, no decoherence.

**Kinetic character ($K$)**:
- $K_\text{fast}$: dynamics dominate over structure. The system equilibrates rapidly.
- $K_\text{mod}$: balanced dynamics. The system can explore its state space at moderate rate.
- $K_\text{slow}$: structure dominates. The system changes slowly; metastability is common.
- $K_\text{trap}$: frozen by order — a coherent many-body gap arrests dynamics (gapped ground state, topological phase). **Assign to gap-protected terminal states.** A system with $K_\text{trap}$ has $C = 0$.
- $K_\text{MBL}$: frozen by disorder — many-body localization arrests dynamics across all eigenstates, not just the ground state. Distinct from $K_\text{trap}$: the mechanism is disorder, not order; area-law entanglement persists in excited states; eigenstate thermalization fails entirely. **Assign only to provably MBL phases.** A system with $K_\text{MBL}$ has $C = 0$.

**Topology ($T$)**:
- $T_\text{network}$: arbitrary graph structure, many-to-many.
- $T_\text{in}$: injective map — the system embeds into a larger space.
- $T_\text{bowtie}$: hourglass — two domains connected through a bottleneck.
- $T_\text{box}$: product structure — the state space is a direct product.
- $T_\odot$: holographic — boundary encodes bulk (use with $D_\odot$).

**Relational mode ($R$)**:
- $R_\text{super}$: one-way classification, no inverse.
- $R_\text{cat}$: categorical — morphisms compose but need not be invertible.
- $R_\dagger$: dagger category — every morphism has an adjoint.
- $R_\text{lr}$: left-right symmetric — fully ambidextrous composition.

**Granularity ($G$)**:
- $G_\beth$: microscopic — the system operates at the finest available scale.
- $G_\gimel$: mesoscopic — intermediate scale.
- $G_\aleph$: macroscopic/universal — the system operates at the scale of the whole, or claims to describe all scales.

**Interaction grammar ($\Gamma$)**:
- $\Gamma_\text{and}$: parallel — all operations fire simultaneously.
- $\Gamma_\text{or}$: alternative — one operation fires at a time, chosen by some gate.
- $\Gamma_\text{seq}$: sequential — operations fire in fixed order.
- $\Gamma_\text{broad}$: broadcast — one operation distributes over many targets (softmax, renormalization group, language).

**Chirality/temporal depth ($H$)**:
- $H_0$: time-symmetric, no chiral asymmetry, no temporal memory.
- $H_1$: one level of temporal depth — the system has a memory of one past state.
- $H_2$: two levels — the system tracks its own rate of change.
- $H_\infty$: infinite temporal depth — the system integrates over its entire history.

**Stoichiometry ($S$)**:
- $1{:}1$: one input, one output. Simple transduction.
- $n{:}n$: many inputs, many outputs, balanced.
- $n{:}m$: many inputs, different number of outputs. Asymmetric transduction.

## Common mistakes

**Assigning $\Phi_c$ too liberally.** A system that is *near* a phase transition is not necessarily *at* $\Phi_c$. Only assign $\Phi_c$ when the system is at or provably flows to a critical fixed point under renormalization.

**Assigning $P_{\pm}^\text{sym}$ without verification.** This is the most frequently over-assigned primitive. It requires that encoding and decoding are exactly inverse — not approximately, not morally, but provably. If in doubt, assign $P_\text{sym}$.

**Confusing spatial dimension with $D$.** A 3D physical system does not automatically get $D_\infty$. $D$ measures the complexity of the *algebra's state space*, not the dimension of the space the system lives in.

**Assigning $K_\text{trap}$ to intermediate layers.** $K_\text{trap}$ propagates under tensor coupling — one trapped block makes the whole chain trapped. Reserve it for final output states.

**Assigning $\Omega \neq \Omega_0$ without a topological invariant.** Topological protection is a precise mathematical property, not a metaphor for robustness. A system that is robust against noise is not necessarily $\Omega_\mathbb{Z}$. Look for a discrete topological invariant (winding number, Chern number, $\mathbb{Z}_2$ index).

**Treating $\Phi_\text{EP}$ as $\Phi_c$.** The exceptional point is near but not at the critical manifold. $\Phi_\text{EP}$ has ordinal 2.67 > $\Phi_c$ = 2.00 in the ordering, meaning $\Phi_\text{EP}$ **destroys $O_\infty$** under tensor coupling — it does not promote to it. A system at an exceptional point is $O_0$.

## The ouroboricity tier

Once $(\Phi, P, \Omega, D)$ are assigned, the tier follows deterministically:

| Rule | Tier | Condition |
|------|------|-----------|
| R1 | $O_\infty$ | $\Phi \in \{\Phi_c, \Phi_c^\mathbb{C}\}$ **and** $P = P_{\pm}^\text{sym}$ |
| R2 | $O_0$ | $\Phi \notin \{\Phi_c, \Phi_c^\mathbb{C}\}$ |
| R3 | $O_1$ | $\Phi \in \{\Phi_c, \Phi_c^\mathbb{C}\}$ **and** $\Omega = \Omega_0$ |
| R4 | $O_2$ | $\Phi \in \{\Phi_c, \Phi_c^\mathbb{C}\}$ **and** $\Omega \neq \Omega_0$ **and** $D \in \{D_\wedge, D_\triangle, D_\odot\}$ |
| R5 | $O_2^\dagger$ | $\Phi \in \{\Phi_c, \Phi_c^\mathbb{C}\}$ **and** $\Omega \neq \Omega_0$ **and** $D = D_\infty$ |

Rules apply in priority order: R1 before R2, R2 before R3–R5.

## What encoding enables

**Structural distance** $d(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{y})$: how different are two systems structurally? Computed as a weighted Euclidean distance over the ordinal values of all 12 primitives. Symmetric. Range: 0 to ~11.

**Directed distance** $d_\to(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{y})$: how much structural work is required to drive system $\mathbf{y}$ from the equilibrium state of $\mathbf{x}$? Asymmetric — $d_\to(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{y}) \neq d_\to(\mathbf{y}, \mathbf{x})$ in general. Used to identify which direction is driven and which is relaxation.

**Tensor product** $\mathbf{x} \otimes \mathbf{y}$: the structural type of two coupled systems. Union primitives take $\max$; bottleneck primitives ($P$, $F$) take $\min$. This is the most important operation for analyzing composite systems.

**Lattice meet** $\mathbf{x} \wedge \mathbf{y}$: the largest structural type contained in both $\mathbf{x}$ and $\mathbf{y}$ — the common subalgebra.

**Lattice join** $\mathbf{x} \vee \mathbf{y}$: the smallest structural type containing both $\mathbf{x}$ and $\mathbf{y}$ — the minimal superalgebra.

**Le Chatelier inversion**: given a driven system $\mathbf{y}$, find the equilibrium algebra $\mathbf{x}^*$ such that $d_\to(\mathbf{y}, \mathbf{x}^*) = 0$, maximizing $\mathcal{O}(\mathbf{x}^*)$. Asks: what is the natural resting state that $\mathbf{y}$ is being driven away from?

**Nearest-neighbor search**: sort the full catalog by $d(\mathbf{x}, \cdot)$ to find the known systems most structurally similar to a new encoding.

All operations are available via `syncon_inquiry.py` (interactive agent) or `syncon` CLI.

## Worked example: the Ising model at criticality

**System**: 2D Ising model at $T = T_c$.

| Primitive | Assignment | Reasoning |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| $\Phi$ | $\Phi_c$ | Exactly at the critical point; scale-free fluctuations; fixed point of RG. |
| $P$ | $P_\pm$ | $\mathbb{Z}_2$ spin-flip symmetry is present but the Frobenius condition is not exactly satisfied (no exact $\mu \circ \delta = \text{id}$). |
| $\Omega$ | $\Omega_{\mathbb{Z}_2}$ | Criticality is protected by the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry: perturbing with a magnetic field (breaking $\mathbb{Z}_2$) immediately destroys the critical point. |
| $D$ | $D_\triangle$ | Finite 2D lattice; sub-infinite state space; mesoscopic. |
| $T$ | $T_\text{box}$ | Product structure: $\sigma_i \in \{-1,+1\}^N$. |
| $R$ | $R_\text{cat}$ | Transfer matrix gives morphisms that compose; no natural adjoint. |
| $F$ | $F_\ell$ | Classical system; no quantum coherence. |
| $K$ | $K_\text{mod}$ | Glauber or Metropolis dynamics — moderate equilibration rate. |
| $G$ | $G_\gimel$ | Mesoscopic scale; not microscopic (single spin) or macroscopic (field theory). |
| $\Gamma$ | $\Gamma_\text{and}$ | All spins updated in parallel (or effectively so in the thermodynamic limit). |
| $H$ | $H_0$ | Time-symmetric Boltzmann distribution; no temporal memory. |
| $S$ | $n{:}n$ | $N$ spins in, $N$ spins out. |

**Tuple**: $\langle D_\triangle;\ T_\text{box};\ R_\text{cat};\ P_\pm;\ F_\ell;\ K_\text{mod};\ G_\gimel;\ \Gamma_\text{and};\ \Phi_c;\ H_0;\ n{:}n;\ \Omega_{\mathbb{Z}_2} \rangle$

**Tier**: R4 applies ($\Phi_c$, $\Omega_{\mathbb{Z}_2} \neq \Omega_0$, $D_\triangle \neq D_\infty$) → $O_2$.
