# Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer Conjecture: Three-Layer Barrier Analysis

**The problem** (Clay Millennium, 2000):
For an elliptic curve E over ℚ, the algebraic rank of E(ℚ) equals
the order of vanishing of its L-function at s = 1:

  rank E(ℚ) = ord_{s=1} L(E, s)

Moreover, the leading coefficient of L(E, s) at s = 1 is given by
the BSD formula involving the real period Ω_E, regulator Reg_E,
Tate-Shafarevich group Ш(E/ℚ), Tamagawa numbers c_v, and torsion:

  lim_{s→1} (s−1)^{−r} L(E,s) = (Ω_E · Reg_E · ∏_v c_v · |Ш(E)|) / |E(ℚ)_tors|²

---

**Three-layer structure** (unique among MPPs: two parallel MathlibGaps + one OpenProblem):

  Layer 1a — `mordell_weil` (MathlibGap): E(ℚ) is finitely generated.
    Proved (Mordell 1922). Not in Mathlib.

  Layer 1b — `mazur_torsion` (MathlibGap): E(ℚ)_tors is one of 15 specific groups.
    Proved (Mazur 1977). Not in Mathlib. The 15 possibilities are ℤ/nℤ for n ≤ 10 or n=12,
    and ℤ/2ℤ × ℤ/2nℤ for n ≤ 4.

  Layer 2 — `bsd_certificate` (OpenProblem): rank E(ℚ) = ord_{s=1} L(E,s).
    No proof exists in general. The two MathlibGap sorries are parallel to this,
    not prerequisites: BSD can be stated without knowing the torsion structure.

**The key structural distinction from YM and OPN:**

  · YM: stacked sorries (existence blocks mass gap — you can't even state mass gap without theory)
  · OPN: methodologically ordered (Euler form is the approach to nonexistence, but both can be stated)
  · BSD: truly parallel (Mordell-Weil, Mazur torsion, and BSD itself are logically independent)

**Mathlib inventory** (v4.28):

  ✓ `WeierstrassCurve R`                  — Weierstrass model Y²+a₁XY+a₃Y = X³+a₂X²+a₄X+a₆
  ✓ `WeierstrassCurve.IsElliptic`         — discriminant ≠ 0 (nonsingularity condition)
  ✓ `WeierstrassCurve.j`                  — j-invariant
  ✓ `WeierstrassCurve.Δ`                  — discriminant
  ✓ `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.Point`       — affine rational points W(F)
  ✓ Point addition, negation, zero        — group law formulas (Affine/Formula.lean)
  ✓ `AddCommGroup` instance on W⟮F⟯       — E(F) is an abelian group
  ✗ Mordell-Weil theorem                  — E(ℚ) finitely generated (MathlibGap)
  ✗ Rank of E(ℚ)                          — not in Mathlib
  ✗ Mazur's torsion theorem               — torsion classification (MathlibGap)
  ✗ L-function L(E,s) for elliptic curves — not in Mathlib (requires modular forms)
  ✗ Modularity theorem (Wiles 1995)       — E/ℚ is modular (MathlibGap)
  ✗ Tate-Shafarevich group Ш(E/ℚ)        — not in Mathlib
  ✗ BSD formula                           — not in Mathlib
  ✗ Gross-Zagier formula                  — not in Mathlib (MathlibGap)
  ✗ Kolyvagin's Euler system              — not in Mathlib (MathlibGap)

---

**Barrier classification**:
  Primary: `OpenProblem` (BSD itself — rank = analytic rank for all E/ℚ)
  Secondary: `MathlibGap` × 2 (Mordell-Weil + Mazur torsion — both proved, neither in Mathlib)

  BSD has the richest landscape of partial results of any Millennium Problem:
  · Rank 0: proved for curves with analytic rank 0 and complex multiplication (Coates-Wiles 1977)
  · Rank 0 and 1: Gross-Zagier + Kolyvagin (1988/1990) — analytic rank ≤ 1 → BSD holds
  · Modularity: every E/ℚ is modular (Wiles-Taylor-Diamond-Conrad-Breuil 1995-2001)
  · Partial BSD: if analytic rank ≤ 1, algebraic rank = analytic rank and |Ш| is finite
  The general case (analytic rank ≥ 2) is completely open.

---

**SynthOmnicon structural note:**

  BSD has primitive tuple D_holo · T_bowtie · F_eth · Γ_and · Φ_c · Ω_Z.
  · D_holo: the modularity theorem makes E/ℚ ↔ modular form a holographic duality.
    Boundary-to-bulk: the L-function on the analytic side corresponds to the rank on the algebraic side.
  · T_bowtie: the functional equation of L(E,s) (symmetry s ↔ 2-s) is a bowtie structure.
  · Φ_c: the rank is a charge-carrier — it counts the "free" part of E(ℚ).
  · Ω_Z: the Tate-Shafarevich group is the topological obstruction; |Ш| is the winding number.
  · F_eth: BSD is a statement about the interplay of algebraic and analytic structure
    (unlike RH which is purely analytic).

  The D_holo structure (modularity) is why BSD is distinct from OPN: OPN is purely arithmetic
  (no boundary-bulk duality), while BSD has holography built in via the modularity theorem.

    The Mordell-Weil group E(ℚ) is finitely generated.

    **Proved** (Mordell 1922 for E/ℚ; Weil 1928 for abelian varieties over number fields).
    **Not in Mathlib**.

    Proof sketch: descent argument — the quotient E(ℚ)/2E(ℚ) is finite (weak Mordell-Weil),
    then the height function gives finiteness of the full group modulo the torsion.

    Required Mathlib infrastructure:
    · Weak Mordell-Weil (finite index step) — needs Galois cohomology + Kummer theory
    · Néron-Tate height — needs archimedean + p-adic analysis
    · Neither is in Mathlib.

/-- **Mazur's Torsion Theorem** (Layer 1b sorry — MathlibGap).

    The torsion subgroup E(ℚ)_tors of any elliptic curve E over ℚ is isomorphic
    to one of exactly 15 groups:
      ℤ/nℤ for n ∈ {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12}
      ℤ/2ℤ × ℤ/2nℤ for n ∈ {1, 2, 3, 4}

    **Proved** (Mazur 1977, "Modular curves and the Eisenstein ideal").
    **Not in Mathlib**.

    Proof uses: modular curves X₁(N), the Eisenstein ideal in Hecke algebras,
    and a careful study of the rational points of X₁(N) for small N.
    This is a deep theorem requiring substantial machinery.

    This sorry WILL eventually go away (it requires modular curve theory in Mathlib,
    which is an active formalization effort). -/

-- §6. Layer 2 — BSD conjecture (OpenProblem)
-- ============================================================

/-- **BSD Rank Conjecture** (Layer 2 sorry — OpenProblem).

    For every elliptic curve E over ℚ: rank E(ℚ) = ord_{s=1} L(E,s).

    This sorry IS NOT a Mathlib gap. The objects are well-defined
    (via the modularity theorem, L(E,s) is entire and well-defined for all s ∈ ℂ).
    The sorry is the conjecture itself.
    BarrierType = `OpenProblem`.

    The sorry is logically PARALLEL to `mordell_weil` and `mazur_torsion`:
    · BSD can be stated (and this sorry written) without discharging Layer 1a/1b.
    · In contrast, discharging BSD would USE the Mordell-Weil structure.

    Known partial results that do NOT discharge the sorry:
    · Coates-Wiles (1977): BSD holds for rank 0 curves with CM. MathlibGap.
    · Gross-Zagier (1983): if analytic rank = 1, there is a point of infinite order.
      Combined with Kolyvagin: BSD holds for analytic rank ≤ 1. MathlibGap.
    · The case analytic rank ≥ 2 is completely open. -/

/-- The three sorries in the BSD library are all PARALLEL (logically independent).
    This is the key structural difference from YM (stacked) and OPN (methodologically ordered).

    · `mordell_weil` can be discharged without knowing BSD or torsion classification.
    · `mazur_torsion` can be discharged without knowing BSD or Mordell-Weil.
    · `bsd_certificate` can be stated independently of the other two.
      (It uses `ellipticRank` and `analyticRank`, which are axioms — not derived from Mordell-Weil.) -/

/-- Sorry depth comparison:
    · BSD: 3 sorries (depth 1 — all parallel, not stacked)
    · YM:  2 sorries (depth 2 — stacked)
    · OPN: 2 sorries (depth 1 — parallel methodologically but independent logically)

    BSD has the most sorries but the shallowest stack. -/
theorem bsd_has_max_parallel_sorries : True := trivial

-- ============================================================
-- §8. The sorry boundary — what must be inhabited
-- ============================================================

/-- **BSDRankCertificate E**: a proof that rank E(ℚ) = ord_{s=1} L(E,s)
    for a specific elliptic curve E.

    This is the analogue of `ZeroFreeStrip 0` (RH) for BSD.
    Unlike `ZeroFreeStrip 0` (where no instance is known), BSD has
    many known instances:
    · The curve y² = x³ − x (rank 0): BSD holds (Coates-Wiles, 1977)
    · Any curve with analytic rank 0 and complex multiplication: Coates-Wiles
    · Any curve with analytic rank ≤ 1: Kolyvagin (1988)

    The general case is open.

    The universal certificate — `BSDRankConjecture` — requires the certificate
    for ALL elliptic curves simultaneously, including rank ≥ 2 cases. -/

    if L(E,1) ≠ 0 (analytic rank 0) then E(ℚ) is finite (algebraic rank 0).

    For any elliptic curve E over ℚ with analytic rank 0 or 1:
    algebraic rank = analytic rank AND |Ш(E/ℚ)| is finite.

    This covers all curves with analytic rank ≤ 1 — the majority of known curves.

    Every elliptic curve E over ℚ is modular: there exists a newform f of weight 2
    such that L(E,s) = L(f,s).

    This is the theorem that makes L(E,s) well-defined and analytically continued.
