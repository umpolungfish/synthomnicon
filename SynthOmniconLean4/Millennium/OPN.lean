# Odd Perfect Numbers: Three-Layer Barrier Analysis

**The problem** (open since antiquity; tracked in Clay-adjacent number theory):
Does there exist an odd perfect number?

A positive integer N is **perfect** if σ(N) = 2N, where σ is the sum-of-divisors function.
Equivalently: N equals the sum of its proper divisors.

Known perfect numbers: 6, 28, 496, 8128, ... — all even (Euclid-Euler theorem).
Are there any odd ones?

---

**Two-layer barrier** (unlike the other MPPs, OPN has a clean two-layer sorry structure):

  Layer 1 — Euler's structure theorem (MathlibGap): If N is an odd perfect number,
    then N has a specific prime factorization: N = p^α · m² where p is prime,
    p ≡ α ≡ 1 (mod 4), and gcd(p, m) = 1.
    **This is a proved theorem** (Euler, ~1747). It is NOT in Mathlib.

  Layer 2 — Nonexistence (OpenProblem): No odd perfect number exists.
    OR a counterexample exists. We don't know which.
    This sorry depends on Layer 1: Euler's form is the starting point for all
    known nonexistence results. Without it, even lower bounds are hard to state.

  This mirrors BSD: MathlibGap (Mazur's theorem) + OpenProblem (BSD formula).

**Mathlib inventory** (v4.28):

  ✓ `Nat.Perfect n`                       — defined: σ₁(n) = 2n (proper divisors sum to n)
  ✓ `Nat.ArithmeticFunction.sigma k n`    — σₖ(n) = ∑_{d|n} d^k
  ✓ `Nat.divisors n`                      — Finset of positive divisors
  ✓ `Nat.properDivisors n`               — proper divisors (d | n, d ≠ n)
  ✓ `Nat.Prime p`                         — primality
  ✓ `Nat.Coprime a b`                     — gcd(a,b) = 1
  ✓ `Nat.Odd n`, `Nat.Even n`             — parity
  ✓ `n % 4`                               — modular arithmetic
  ✗ Euler's structure theorem for OPN    — proved (1747) but NOT in Mathlib
  ✗ Touchard's theorem (N ≡ 1, 9 mod 36 or N ≡ 441, 9 mod 468)  — not in Mathlib
  ✗ OPN nonexistence                     — open problem, not in Mathlib

**Barrier classification**:
  Layer 1 (Euler form): `MathlibGap` — proved in mathematics, not formalized.
  Layer 2 (nonexistence): `OpenProblem` — no proof exists.

  Key distinction from RH/Hodge/NS: this sorry WILL partially go away.
  Euler's structure theorem could be added to Mathlib — it's a classical result
  requiring only elementary number theory. The nonexistence sorry will not go away
  until the mathematical problem is solved.

**SynthOmnicon structural note:**

  OPN has primitive tuple D_holo · T_bowtie · F_hbar · Γ_and · Φ_c · Ω_Z.
  · D_holo: the problem lives in multiplicative structure of ℕ (number-theoretic holomorphic).
  · T_bowtie: the sigma constraint creates a balance condition (σ = 2N is symmetric).
  · Φ_c + Ω_Z: the interaction between the prime factorization (Φ_c charge carriers)
    and the sigma condition (Ω_Z topological winding) creates the OPN constraint.
  · The Euler form reveals the Φ_c structure: one "special" prime (p = Φ_c carrier)
    and the rest squared (background).
  The Ω_Z annotation (like RH, BSD, Hodge) indicates a global topological constraint —
  the sigma function's multiplicativity creates a holistic condition across all prime factors.

-- ============================================================
-- §2. Euler's structure theorem — Layer 1 sorry (MathlibGap)
-- ============================================================

/-- **Euler's OPN Structure Theorem** (Layer 1 sorry — MathlibGap).

    If N is an odd perfect number, then N has the form:
      N = p^α · m²
    where:
      · p is a prime with p ≡ 1 (mod 4)
      · α ≡ 1 (mod 4)  (so α is odd, specifically ≡ 1 mod 4)
      · gcd(p, m) = 1  (p does not divide m)
      · p ∤ m

    This is the "Euler prime" of N: the distinguished prime p is the unique prime
    factor appearing to an odd power.

    **This theorem IS proved** (Euler, ~1747). It is NOT in Mathlib.
    Proof sketch:
      (1) Write N = ∏ pᵢ^{αᵢ}. Since σ₁ is multiplicative: σ₁(N) = ∏ σ₁(pᵢ^{αᵢ}).
      (2) σ₁(N) = 2N is even. Since N is odd, all pᵢ are odd, so all σ₁(pᵢ^{αᵢ})
          must combine to give exactly one factor of 2.
      (3) σ₁(p^α) = 1 + p + p² + ... + p^α ≡ α+1 (mod 2) for odd p.
          So σ₁(p^α) is even iff α is odd.
      (4) Exactly one prime power must have σ₁(p^α) even (to contribute the factor 2).
          All others must have σ₁(p^α) odd (α even → exponent is even → contributes p^{2k}).
      (5) The "Euler prime" p^α: σ₁(p^α) = 2^a · (odd). For σ₁(N) = 2N (exactly one
          factor of 2 from the structure): α ≡ 1 (mod 4) and p ≡ 1 (mod 4).
      The ≡ 1 (mod 4) condition comes from: p odd prime, p^α ≡ 1 (mod 4) requires
      p ≡ 1 (mod 4) (since if p ≡ 3 (mod 4) and α ≡ 1 (mod 4), then p^α ≡ 3 (mod 4)).

    This sorry WILL go away as Mathlib's number theory grows. -/

-- §3. Consequences of Euler's form
-- ============================================================

/-- If N = p^α · m² is an OPN, then N ≡ 1 (mod 4).
    Proof: p ≡ 1 (mod 4), α odd → p^α ≡ 1 (mod 4). m² ≡ 0 or 1 (mod 4).
    This is a consequence of Euler's structure — also a MathlibGap. -/

  sorry
  -- MathlibGap: follows from Euler's structure theorem (euler_opn_structure).
  -- Using p ≡ α ≡ 1 (mod 4) → p^α ≡ 1 (mod 4) → N ≡ 1 (mod 4).

/-- Any odd perfect number N has at least 9 distinct prime factors.
    Known lower bound from computer search and theory (Chein 1979, Nielsen 2006).
    Both the search and the theorem are MathlibGap. -/

  sorry
  -- MathlibGap: Nielsen (2006) proved ≥ 9 prime factors.
  -- Requires Euler's structure + sigma bounds + extensive case analysis.

/-- Any odd perfect number exceeds 10^1500.
    Known from computational searches (Ochem-Rao 2012 proved N > 10^1500).
    This is a MathlibGap: the bound is proved but not in Mathlib. -/

    (10 : ℕ)^1500 < N := by

-- ============================================================
-- §4. The nonexistence sorry — Layer 2 (OpenProblem)
-- ============================================================

/-- **OPN Nonexistence** (Layer 2 sorry — OpenProblem).

    No odd perfect number exists.

    This sorry DEPENDS on Layer 1 (Euler's structure): all known approaches to
    proving nonexistence start from the Euler form N = p^α · m².

    This sorry DOES NOT depend on Layer 1 being formalized — it is logically
    independent. But methodologically, Layer 1 is the entry point.

    Unlike Euler's structure (which is proved), this sorry has NO known proof.
    The problem has been open since at least Descartes' era (early 17th century).

    Known constraints that do NOT discharge the sorry:
    · N > 10^1500 (Ochem-Rao 2012) — size lower bound
    · N has ≥ 9 distinct prime factors (Nielsen 2006)
    · The Euler prime p satisfies p^α > 10^62 (recent results)
    · N is not divisible by 105 = 3·5·7 (various partial results)
    None of these prove nonexistence; they tighten the search space. -/

  sorry
  -- OPN nonexistence. Open problem since antiquity (~Descartes c.1638, formally since Euler).
  -- No proof exists. The problem is significantly older than the Clay problems.
  -- BarrierType = OpenProblem.

-- ============================================================
-- §5. Stacked sorry structure — Layer analysis
-- ============================================================

/-- The two sorries are NOT stacked in the YM sense:
    `opn_nonexistence` can be stated without `euler_opn_structure`.
    They are parallel sorries with different barrier types.
    (Unlike YM where sorry 2 cannot even be stated without sorry 1.) -/
theorem opn_sorries_are_parallel : True := trivial
  -- Contrast with YM: `ym_mass_gap` requires T : QuantumYMTheory (from sorry 1).
  -- Here: `opn_nonexistence` is a closed statement requiring no input from Layer 1.
  -- The dependency is methodological, not logical.

/-- Euler's structure theorem is a MathlibGap, not an OpenProblem.
    This sorry WILL be discharged; `opn_nonexistence` will not (until the problem is solved). -/
theorem opn_layer1_vs_layer2_distinction :
    -- Layer 1 (euler_opn_structure) is MathlibGap: proved, not in Mathlib.
    -- Layer 2 (opn_nonexistence) is OpenProblem: not proved anywhere.
    True := trivial

-- ============================================================
-- §6. Comparison with even perfect numbers
-- ============================================================

/-- The Euclid-Euler theorem: even perfect numbers are exactly 2^(p-1)(2^p - 1)
    where 2^p - 1 is a Mersenne prime.
    This IS proved (Euclid: sufficient; Euler 1747: necessary).
    It is a MathlibGap in Mathlib. -/
theorem euclid_euler_even_perfect (N : ℕ) (heven : 2 ∣ N) (hperf : IsPerfect N) :
    ∃ p : ℕ, Nat.Prime p ∧ Nat.Prime (2^p - 1) ∧ N = 2^(p-1) * (2^p - 1) := by
  sorry
  -- MathlibGap: Euclid-Euler theorem. Proved (~300 BCE + 1747). Not in Mathlib.
  -- This is MUCH easier than OPN: the characterization is complete for even numbers.
  -- The OPN problem is hard precisely because odd numbers lack this clean structure.

/-- The asymmetry: even perfect numbers are fully classified (modulo Mersenne primes);
    odd perfect numbers are not known to exist. This structural asymmetry is a
    primitive signature of the problem: D_holo structure for even case (Mersenne structure
    is holomorphic in the prime tower); the odd case lacks this organizing principle. -/
