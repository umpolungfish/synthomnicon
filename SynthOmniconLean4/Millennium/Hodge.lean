# Hodge Conjecture: Three-Layer Barrier Analysis

**The problem** (Clay Millennium, 2000):
On a smooth projective complex algebraic variety X, every rational Hodge class
in H^{2p}(X, ℚ) ∩ H^{p,p}(X, ℂ) is a rational linear combination of
fundamental classes of algebraic subvarieties.

Equivalently: the cycle class map cl : CH^p(X) ⊗ ℚ → H^{2p}(X, ℚ) ∩ H^{p,p}
is surjective for every p.

**Three layers:**

  Layer 1 — Skeleton: declare the algebraic geometry infrastructure as axioms
    (smooth projective varieties, Hodge decomposition, algebraic cycles, cycle class map);
    sorry only the algebraic representability certificate.

  Layer 2 — Equivalence: the sorry is tight — it is literally the Hodge conjecture.
    `sorry_iff_hodge` shows the sorry cannot be decomposed further.

  Layer 3 — Barrier: the sorry requires inhabiting `AlgebraicCycleRep X p α` — a pair
    consisting of an algebraic cycle Z of codimension p and a proof that its class equals α.
    This type cannot be inhabited from Mathlib because no proof exists that all
    rational (p,p)-classes arise from algebraic cycles.

**Barrier classification**: `OpenProblem`.

  Unlike YM (where `PathIntegralMeasure` doesn't exist as a rigorous type),
  the Hodge conjecture is about well-defined objects:
  · Smooth projective complex varieties exist as rigorous mathematical objects.
  · Hodge decomposition exists (Hodge 1950, proved using harmonic analysis).
  · Rational Hodge classes are well-defined.
  · Algebraic cycles and their fundamental classes are well-defined.
  The conjecture asks whether a specific surjectivity holds — a well-posed question.
  We don't know the answer.

  Known special cases that do NOT discharge the sorry:
  · p = 1: Lefschetz (1, 1) theorem (1924) — Hodge classes in H^{1,1} are algebraic.
    This is the ONLY confirmed case; it uses the exponential sheaf sequence.
  · Abelian varieties (Lefschetz, Mumford): partial results, not general.
  · Hypersurfaces of degree ≤ 3 in ℙ^n: classical projective geometry.
  · Counterexamples exist for integral Hodge classes (Atiyah-Hirzebruch 1962) —
    the ℚ hypothesis is essential.

**SynthOmnicon structural note:**

  Hodge is the ONLY Millennium Problem with both D_holo and T_holo simultaneously.
  All other MPPs with D_holo (RH, BSD, OPN) have T_network or T_bowtie, not T_holo.
  The double-holomorphic structure (complex variety + Hodge decomposition) is the
  primitive signature of the problem.

  The barrier is an R-degeneracy issue: the Hodge class lives at the intersection
  of topology (H^{2p}(X, ℚ)) and complex analysis (H^{p,p}(X, ℂ)).
  It exists at both levels simultaneously. The conjecture asks whether this
  R-degenerate class can be "lifted" to algebra — to CH^p(X).
  The lift is the missing `AlgebraicCycleRep`.

  Primitive analog: R-lift blocked. The meet of the topological and algebraic
  synthons does not equal the algebraic synthon — the degenerate position does not
  force algebraic representability.

-- §1. Abstract types — the missing algebraic geometry
-- ============================================================

-- These types are declared as axioms because the required infrastructure
-- (Hodge theory, Chow groups, cycle class map) is not in Mathlib.
-- They are not missing because they don't exist in mathematics — they are
-- standard objects in algebraic geometry (Griffiths-Harris, Voisin).
-- The sorry below is NOT about these types being ill-defined.

/-- A smooth projective complex algebraic variety of (complex) dimension n.

    Formally: a smooth integral scheme X, proper over Spec ℂ, with an ample line bundle.
    The smoothness condition ensures the Hodge decomposition exists.
    Mathlib has `AlgebraicGeometry.Scheme` but lacks the smooth projective theory. -/
axiom SmoothProjectiveVariety : Type*

/-- The complex dimension of a smooth projective variety. -/
axiom complexDim : SmoothProjectiveVariety → ℕ

/-- The rational Hodge class group in degree 2p: the intersection
    H^{2p}(X, ℚ) ∩ H^{p,p}(X, ℂ) inside H^{2p}(X, ℂ).

    Elements of this group are called **rational Hodge classes** (or just Hodge classes).
    They satisfy two conditions simultaneously:
      (1) They lie in H^{2p}(X, ℚ) — rational cohomology.
      (2) Under the Hodge decomposition, they lie entirely in the (p,p) summand.

    The p = 0 case gives H^0(X, ℚ) = ℚ (for connected X) — trivially all algebraic.
    The p = 1 case is the (1,1)-theorem: every Hodge class in H^2 is c_1(L) for some
    line bundle L (proved; this is the Lefschetz theorem, NOT the Hodge conjecture).
    The p = 2 and higher cases are open. -/
axiom HodgeCohomology (X : SmoothProjectiveVariety) (p : ℕ) : Type*

/-- The zero Hodge class (additive identity). -/
axiom HodgeClass.zero (X : SmoothProjectiveVariety) (p : ℕ) : HodgeCohomology X p

/-- An algebraic cycle of codimension p on X.

    Formally: a finite ℤ-linear combination of irreducible closed subvarieties Z ↪ X
    of codimension p. Modulo rational equivalence, these form the Chow group CH^p(X).

    Well-defined in mathematics; not formalized in Mathlib. -/
axiom AlgebraicCycle (X : SmoothProjectiveVariety) (p : ℕ) : Type*

/-- The cycle class map: sends an algebraic cycle to its cohomology class.

    cl : CH^p(X) ⊗ ℚ → H^{2p}(X, ℚ) ∩ H^{p,p}(X, ℂ)

    This is a well-defined map; it follows from the theory of currents and the fact
    that fundamental classes of algebraic subvarieties are Hodge classes (by type reasons).
    The Hodge conjecture asks about its *surjectivity*. -/

-- §3. The sorry boundary — Layer 1
-- ============================================================

/-- **The Hodge Conjecture** (Layer 1 sorry).

    Every rational Hodge class on a smooth projective complex variety is algebraic.

    This sorry is NOT a Mathlib gap. The algebraic geometry infrastructure
    (varieties, cycles, Hodge decomposition) exists in mathematics; the sorry
    is not about formalizing that infrastructure.

    The sorry IS the conjecture itself.
    BarrierType = `OpenProblem` (see Barriers.lean).

    The type required to discharge it: `AlgebraicCycleRep X p α`
    (see §5 below). Constructing such a value for all X, p, α IS the Hodge conjecture. -/

  sorry

/-- The p = 0 case is trivially provable: every variety has H^0 = ℚ, and the
    fundamental class [X] (codimension 0) represents the generator.

    but sorry here as a MathlibGap since the exponential sheaf sequence is not in Mathlib). -/

-- ============================================================

/-- **AlgebraicCycleRep X p α**: a witness that the Hodge class α is algebraic.

    This is the type that must be inhabited to discharge `hodge_certificate`.
    It packages:
      (1) An algebraic cycle Z of codimension p.
      (2) A proof that cycleClass Z = α.

    This type IS well-defined in mathematics — unlike `PathIntegralMeasure` in YM,
    where the type has no rigorous construction at all. Here, AlgebraicCycleRep X p α
    exists for many specific (X, p, α) — just not for ALL (X, p, α).
    The conjecture is that it exists universally.

    The Lefschetz (1,1) theorem shows AlgebraicCycleRep X 1 α is always inhabited.
    No analogous theorem exists for p ≥ 2.

    **The missing mathematical object**: a proof that the cycle class map is surjective.
    Unlike RH (where `ZeroFreeStrip 0` requires finding zeros that may not exist),
    and unlike YM (where `PathIntegralMeasure` requires building new mathematics),
    Hodge requires showing that a map between existing objects is surjective. -/
def AlgebraicCycleRep (X : SmoothProjectiveVariety) (p : ℕ) (α : HodgeCohomology X p) : Prop :=
  IsAlgebraicClass X p α

/-- **Barrier theorem**: discharging `hodge_certificate` is equivalent to showing
    `AlgebraicCycleRep X p α` holds for all X, p, α. -/
theorem hodge_barrier :
    HodgeConjecture ↔
    ∀ (X : SmoothProjectiveVariety) (p : ℕ) (α : HodgeCohomology X p),
      AlgebraicCycleRep X p α := by
  simp only [HodgeConjecture, AlgebraicCycleRep, IsAlgebraicClass]

/-- The sorry in `hodge_certificate` is equivalent to universal surjectivity of
    the cycle class map. This is the formal statement of the barrier. -/
theorem hodge_sorry_requires_cycle_class_surjectivity :
    HodgeConjecture ↔
    (∀ (X : SmoothProjectiveVariety) (p : ℕ),
      Function.Surjective (cycleClass X p)) := by
  simp only [HodgeConjecture, IsAlgebraicClass, Function.Surjective]

/-- **The missing mathematical object** (formal statement).

    To discharge `hodge_certificate`, one must construct, for every smooth projective
    complex variety X and every rational Hodge class α ∈ H^{2p}(X, ℚ) ∩ H^{p,p},
    an algebraic cycle Z with cycleClass Z = α.

    This type has the following properties:

      (1) Nonempty for p = 1: Lefschetz (1,1) theorem. The exponential sheaf sequence
          0 → ℤ → 𝒪_X → 𝒪_X* → 0 shows every (1,1) class is c_1(L) for a line bundle L.
          Every line bundle has a divisor class — an algebraic cycle.
          This is NOT a Lean/Mathlib proof; the (1,1) theorem is a MathlibGap here.

      (2) Nonempty for p = dimX: every 0-cycle (a point) has class = its point class.

      (3) Nonempty in many specific cases (abelian varieties of low dim, Fermat hypersurfaces).

      (4) NOT known to be universally nonempty for p ≥ 2 and general X.
          This is the content of the Hodge conjecture.

    Contrast with RH: ZeroFreeStrip 0 has no known instances; partial results give only
    ZeroFreeStrip δ(t) for shrinking δ. Here, partial results DO give instances —
    the barrier is universality, not existence of any example. -/
theorem hodge_sorry_requires_algebraic_cycle_rep :
    HodgeConjecture ↔

      AlgebraicCycleRep X p α :=
  hodge_barrier

-- §6. Structural comparison with other MPPs
-- ============================================================

/-- The Hodge conjecture is structurally distinct from RH:
    · RH: the missing type is a *constraint* (ZeroFreeStrip 0 — no zeros off-axis).
    · Hodge: the missing type is a *lift* (AlgebraicCycleRep — topology → algebra).
    Both are OpenProblems, but in different structural positions.

    In SynthOmnicon primitive terms:
    · RH: Φ_c constraint failure — no Φ_c-certified position off critical line.
    · Hodge: R-lift failure — R-degenerate class does not force algebraic representative. -/

/-- The Hodge conjecture is NOT a MissingFoundation problem.
