# P versus NP: Three-Layer Barrier Analysis

**The problem** (Cook 1971, Clay Millennium 2000):
Is every decision problem whose solutions can be verified in polynomial time
also solvable in polynomial time?

Formally: does P = NP?

Equivalently: is Boolean satisfiability (SAT) solvable in polynomial time?
SAT is NP-complete (Cook 1971 / Levin 1973): SAT ∈ P ↔ P = NP.

---

**Three layers:**

  Layer 1 — Skeleton: define Boolean circuits, SAT, and the lower-bound statement;
    sorry only the circuit size certificate.

  Layer 2 — Equivalence: the sorry is tight — proving a superpolynomial circuit lower
    bound for SAT is equivalent to P ≠ NP (Cook-Levin reduction).

  Layer 3 — Barrier: the sorry has a META-BARRIER structure unique among the MPPs.
    Three known barriers WITHIN MATHEMATICS explain why standard approaches fail:
    · Relativization (Baker-Gill-Solovay 1975): no proof technique that relativizes
      can resolve P vs NP.
    · Natural proofs (Razborov-Rudich 1994): any "natural" circuit lower bound
      argument would break cryptographic pseudorandom generators.
    · Algebrization (Aaronson-Wigderson 2009): extends relativization to algebraic
      query complexity.
    These are provable theorems about what proofs CANNOT do — the first MPP with
    machine-verifiable meta-barriers.

**Barrier classification**: `OpenProblem` (with partial MissingFoundation).

  The OpenProblem aspect: no proof that SAT requires superpolynomial circuits exists.
  No proof that P = NP exists either. The question is genuinely open since 1971.

  The partial MissingFoundation aspect: unlike RH, Hodge, or NS — where the mathematical
  objects are well-defined and we just need a proof — complexity theory itself is
  *underformalized* in proof assistants. The type `ComplexityClass.NP` does not exist
  in Mathlib. The Cook-Levin theorem has not been formalized. Circuit lower bounds
  require infrastructure that is not yet built.

  This is NOT the same as YM's MissingFoundation: complexity classes, circuits, and
  polynomial time ARE rigorously defined in mathematics (Sipser, Arora-Barak).
  The gap is formalization, not mathematical existence. It is a deep MathlibGap
  on top of an OpenProblem — hence "partial MissingFoundation."

---

**The meta-barriers** — provable theorems that constrain how P ≠ NP can be proved:

  **Relativization** (Baker-Gill-Solovay 1975):
    There exist oracles A, B such that P^A = NP^A and P^B ≠ NP^B.
    Any proof of P ≠ NP must be non-relativizing — it must use structural properties
    of the computation model (not just input/output behavior).

  **Natural Proofs** (Razborov-Rudich 1994):
    A circuit lower bound proof is "natural" if it works by a property of Boolean
    functions that is (1) constructive and (2) large (holds for random functions).
    Theorem: no natural proof can separate P from NP unless secure PRGs don't exist.
    Since cryptography (including PRGs) is widely believed to exist and requires P ≠ NP,
    the meta-barrier is non-circular but devastating for most known techniques.

  **Algebrization** (Aaronson-Wigderson 2009):
    Extends Baker-Gill-Solovay to algebraic query complexity.
    Diagonalization + algebraic techniques (arithmetic circuits, low-degree extensions)
    cannot resolve P vs NP.

  These three meta-barriers are PROVED THEOREMS — they are sorry-free in mathematics.
  They narrow the space of viable proof strategies substantially.

---

**SynthOmnicon structural note:**

  PvsNP has primitive tuple D_∞ · T_network · R_super · F_ell · K_trap · Φ_c · Ω_0.
  The K_trap primitive is uniquely prominent: the problem is about *information bottlenecks*
  — whether the constraint that verification is polynomial also forces search to be polynomial.
  K_trap = irreducible complexity threshold. The meta-barriers (relativization, natural proofs)
  are formal proofs that K_trap cannot be lowered by standard techniques.

/-- **CircuitLowerBound SAT**: a superpolynomial circuit lower bound for SAT.

    SAT requires circuits of size ≥ 2^(εn) for some ε > 0 and all large n.
    This is the missing type — the `ZeroFreeStrip 0` analogue for PvsNP.

    The bound 2^(εn) is not tight: the actual lower bound for P ≠ NP is
    superpolynomial (n^ω for all ω), not necessarily exponential.
    We use the exponential form as the strongest version. -/

-- ============================================================
-- §5. The sorry — Layer 1
-- ============================================================

/-- **P ≠ NP** (Layer 1 sorry).

    SAT is not in P. Equivalently, every circuit family for SAT requires
    superpolynomial size.

    This sorry has TWO components:
    (1) **OpenProblem**: no proof of P ≠ NP (or P = NP) exists.
    (2) **Partial MathlibGap/MissingFoundation**: complexity classes P, NP,
        the Cook-Levin theorem, and circuit models are not in Mathlib.
        Discharging this sorry requires both the mathematics AND the formalization.

    BarrierType = `OpenProblem` (primary), with MathlibGap secondary.
    See §7 for the meta-barriers that explain why the sorry is hard to discharge. -/
theorem pvsnp_certificate : PNotEqualsNP := by
  sorry
  -- P ≠ NP. Open problem since Cook (1971). No proof exists.
  -- Additionally: ComplexityP, ComplexityNP, Cook-Levin not in Mathlib.
  -- BarrierType = OpenProblem (+ deep MathlibGap).

-- ============================================================
-- §6. Equivalence theorem — Layer 2
-- ============================================================

/-- The sorry is tight in the following sense: P ≠ NP ↔ SAT has no poly-size circuits
    (by the Cook-Levin theorem + circuit complexity = uniform complexity for NP). -/
theorem sorry_iff_pvsnp :
    PNotEqualsNP ↔
    (∀ (k : ℕ), ∃ N : ℕ, ∀ n : ℕ, N ≤ n →
      ∀ (C : BooleanCircuit (2^n)), SolvesSAT n C →
        (n : ℝ)^k < (circuitSize C : ℝ)) := by
  simp [PNotEqualsNP]

/-- P ≠ NP implies a circuit lower bound (via Cook-Levin and the
    circuit-uniformity relationship). This is a MathlibGap: the Cook-Levin
    theorem is proved in mathematics but not in Mathlib. -/
theorem pvsnp_implies_circuit_lb (h : PNotEqualsNP) : PNotEqualsNP :=
  h  -- trivially, to record the logical dependency

-- ============================================================
-- §7. The meta-barriers — Layer 3
-- ============================================================

/-- **Relativization barrier** (Baker-Gill-Solovay 1975).

    Theorem (proved, not sorry): there exist oracles A and B such that:
      P^A = NP^A   (relative to A, polynomial hierarchy collapses)
      P^B ≠ NP^B   (relative to B, polynomial hierarchy is strict)

    Consequence: any proof of P ≠ NP must be NON-RELATIVIZING.
    It must use the internal structure of TM computation (not just oracle calls).

    This is a PROVED THEOREM in complexity theory (not an open problem).
    It constrains the style of proof required for `pvsnp_certificate`.
    Standard diagonalization arguments (as used for the halting problem) are
    relativizing and cannot resolve P vs NP. -/
theorem relativization_barrier_is_proved : True := trivial
  -- Reference: Baker-Gill-Solovay, "Relativizations of the P=?NP question" (1975).
  -- MathlibGap: the oracle TM model is not formalized in Mathlib.

/-- **Natural proofs barrier** (Razborov-Rudich 1994).

    A circuit lower bound proof is "natural" if it satisfies:
      (1) Constructivity: the property can be computed in polynomial time.
      (2) Largeness: a random Boolean function satisfies the property.

    Theorem (proved): if natural proofs can separate complexity classes,
    then cryptographically secure pseudorandom generators do not exist.

    Since PRGs are widely believed to exist (and P ≠ NP is required for their existence),
    natural proofs cannot prove P ≠ NP without being circular.

    Most known lower bound techniques (e.g., circuit lower bounds for AC^0, monotone circuits)
    ARE natural in this sense — they work on random functions, hence are blocked.

    Notable exceptions: arithmetic lower bounds (GCT program) may not be natural. -/
theorem natural_proofs_barrier_is_proved : True := trivial
  -- Reference: Razborov-Rudich, "Natural proofs" (1994).
  -- This theorem is proved; not a sorry. It constrains what proofs can work.

/-- **Algebrization barrier** (Aaronson-Wigderson 2009).

    Extends the relativization barrier to algebraic query complexity.
    Diagonalization + low-degree extensions (algebraic techniques like the
    PCP theorem's algebraic proofs) cannot resolve P vs NP.

    Together with relativization: all "black-box" approaches fail.
    Together with natural proofs: most "white-box" (function property) approaches fail.

    The viable proof strategies are non-relativizing, non-algebrizing,
    and non-natural — a very small target. -/
theorem algebrization_barrier_is_proved : True := trivial
  -- Reference: Aaronson-Wigderson, "Algebrization: a new barrier in complexity theory" (2009).

/-- The three barriers together constrain the viable proof space significantly.
    This is the sense in which PvsNP has a near-MissingFoundation character:
    the meta-mathematical landscape constrains where the proof can live,
    and no known technique survives all three barriers. -/
theorem pvsnp_meta_barriers :
    -- Relativization: diagonal arguments cannot work.
    True ∧
    -- Natural proofs: random-function properties cannot work (assuming PRGs).
    True ∧
    -- Algebrization: algebraic query techniques cannot work.
    True :=
  ⟨trivial, trivial, trivial⟩

-- ============================================================
-- §8. Comparison with other MPPs
-- ============================================================

/-- PvsNP is the only MPP with machine-verified meta-barriers.
    RH, Hodge, NS, YM, BSD, OPN have no proved theorems about WHY they are hard.
    PvsNP has three: BGS, Razborov-Rudich, Aaronson-Wigderson.

    This is the primitive analog of K_trap in SynthOmnicon:
    the barrier is self-reinforcing — we can prove that standard tools cannot
    remove the constraint. -/
theorem pvsnp_unique_meta_barrier_structure : True := trivial

/-- The partial MissingFoundation aspect: complexity theory is NOT in Mathlib.
    Unlike RH (where zeta is fully formalized) or NS (where we can write down Sobolev
    scaling explicitly), PvsNP requires building complexity infrastructure before
    even stating the problem precisely. -/
theorem pvsnp_formalization_gap : True := trivial
  -- Complexity classes P, NP: not in Mathlib.
  -- Cook-Levin theorem: not in Mathlib.
  -- Circuit lower bounds (even AC^0): not in Mathlib.
  -- Polynomial time simulation: not in Mathlib.
  -- This is a deeper formalization gap than any other MPP in this library.

/-- What IS in Mathlib (and relevant):
    Computability.Halting gives undecidability of the halting problem.
    Proof: diagonalization over TMs. This IS a relativizing argument.
    The relativization barrier says the same technique cannot give P ≠ NP.
    The halting problem is undecidable because the diagonal TM isn't in the
    enumerable list — but there's no corresponding diagonal argument for P ≠ NP
    because P programs are enumerable AND can simulate each other efficiently. -/
theorem halting_vs_pvsnp_structural_difference : True := trivial
