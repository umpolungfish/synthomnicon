# SynthOmnicon Framework: Comprehensive Usage Guide (v0.5.1)

**Version 0.5.1** — Periodic Crystal Navigator · §69 Tier Gap Ladder · §68.4/§68.5 Arithmetic Ouroboros minimality · ENCODING_EPISTEMOLOGY · 1,322 catalog entries · 454+ predictions · 69 formal theorems.

New in v0.5.1:

- **`crystal_navigator.py`** — bijective Frobenius codec over 10,368,000 structural types. Mixed-radix address space: boundary (Φ, P, Ω, D) → 300 tier cells; bulk (T, R, F, K, G, Γ, H, S) → 34,560 inner types per cell. `python crystal_navigator.py repl` for interactive navigation.
- **§69 Tier Gap Ladder** — exact adjacent distances: $d(O_0, O_1) \approx 1.049$, $d(O_1, O_2) \approx 1.304$, $d(O_2, O_2^\dagger) = 1.000$, $d(O_2^\dagger, O_\infty) \approx 4.382$. Frobenius cliff is 3.36× the next-largest gap; non-tunable by gradient methods.
- **§68.4 Primitives-First Derivation** — the exponent of each base in $3^4 \times 4^5 \times 5^3$ is literally the count of primitive variables in that family. Not observed — forced by product structure.
- **§68.5 Minimality** — $\{3,4,5\}$ is the unique minimal self-anchored triple; phase completeness (Φ, T, P each need 5 values) forces max base ≥ 5 and hence n₁ ≥ 3.
- **ENCODING_EPISTEMOLOGY.md** — theory of how encoding achieves determinism: structural reality vs ontological realization, monadic gating, comparative encoding, multi-session convergence, 9 convergence criteria.

## 1. Introduction to SynthOmnicon

### Foundational Insight: Primitives as Directed Constraints

The eleven primitives `⟨D; T; R; P; F; K; G; Γ; Φ; S; Ω⟩` are **relational operators**, not intrinsic attributes. Every primitive describes a constraint between entities or a capacity for interaction — none describes an isolated property of a system standing alone.

This has a practical consequence: the framework's confirmed predictions (see `PRIMITIVE_PREDICTIONS.md`) were all derived from **ordinal comparisons**, not absolute values. The CB[7] displacement hierarchy (6/6 experimental matches) was predicted from `F_ℏ > F_eth > F_ℓ` alone. The Soai Frank-bifurcation was predicted from the co-occurrence pattern `D_∞ + T_⋈ + P_DA + F_ℏ`. Intrinsic scalar properties — binding enthalpy, hydrophobicity, gap magnitude — were not required as inputs.

The compositional algebra (`meet`, `join`, `tensor`, `path`, `lift`) has no unary information generators. Every operation requires at least one additional operand — environment, partner, or target state. You cannot call `tensor(photon)` without a second argument; the algebra returns an error. A synthon's tuple describes its *interaction-ready potential*; the algebra computes only when that potential is actualized against another term.

### What's New in v0.4.1?

**Molecular Domain Catalog — Persistent Synthon Registration** (March 17, 2026):

1. **`synthomnicon/domains/molecular/__init__.py`** — `register_molecular_synthons()` added. Nine canonical molecular and supramolecular synthons are now programmatically registered at import time, surviving catalog JSON resets:

   | Synthon | D | T | F | Role |
   |---------|---|---|---|------|
   | `nitroso_radical_redox_synthon_pair` | D_∞ | T_⋈ | F_ℏ | Temporal autocatalytic redox cycle; Frank-model Factor 7 fires (score > 0.3); start point for criticality-ascent designs |
   | `amide_dimer` | D_∧ | T_⋈ | F_eth | N–H···O=C H-bonded dimer; F_eth weaker than carboxylic acid dimer (F_ℏ); lattice floor/ceiling pair for design 03 |
   | `nitroso_radical_anion_π_cavitand_cage_synthon` | D_△ | T_cage | F_ℏ | Deep-cavity anion–π cavitand; shape-selective cage, K_slow |
   | `nitroso_radical_calixarene_anion_π_sandwich_synthon` | D_△ | T_bowl | F_ℏ | Calixarene bowl; open cup, T_bowl < T_cage in ordinal (fallback partner in or-strategy) |
   | `nitroso_radical_crown_ether_host_guest_synthon` | D_△ | T_cage | F_eth | Crown ether host–guest; flexible macrocycle → F_eth (fidelity bottleneck partner in design 12) |
   | `nitroso_radical_anion_π_cryptand_cage_synthon` | D_△ | T_cage | F_ℏ | Cryptand cage; 3D bicyclic preorganisation → F_ℏ (design 16 start) |
   | `nitroso_radical_cucurbituril_anion_rotaxane_synthon` | D_△ | T_cage | F_ℏ | CB[n] barrel; high rigidity (F_ℏ), slow dethreading (K_slow); tensor partner in designs 12 and 16 |
   | `synthon_methyl_anion_nucleophile_CH3_` | D_∧ | T_\| | F_eth | CH₃⁻ carbanion; P_minus; retrodesign target in designs 08 and 10 |
   | `synthon_methyl_cation_electrophile_CH3` | D_∧ | T_\| | F_eth | CH₃⁺ carbocation; P_plus; tensor partner for anion-cation MI demonstration (design 10) |

2. **Design suite: all 20 `.syn` scripts execute without `[ERROR]`** — 18 succeed, 2 are intentional F-floor pedagogical demonstrations (designs 01 and 04). All previously `[ERROR]` failures caused by missing catalog entries are now resolved.

3. **`register_molecular_synthons()` wired to `synthomnicon/__init__.py`** — auto-invoked on `import synthomnicon`, idempotent. Registration order: cross-domain → quantum → molecular.

### What's New in v0.3.0?

**Four Protocol Modules** (March 15, 2026):

1. **SYNTHONIC_PERTURBATION** (`synthomnicon/perturbation.py`):
   - `PerturbationEngine.sweep_all(synthon, delta_g)` — primitive Jacobian: Δξ_CP for every primitive ±1 tier
   - `PerturbationEngine.fault_injection(synthon, delta_g)` — single-point-of-failure analysis
   - `PerturbationEngine.find_path_to_target(synthon, delta_g, target_xi_CP, optimize_primitives)` — minimum-step tuning path
   - CLI: `syncon perturb sweep <name> --delta-g <float>`

2. **SYNTHONIC_TRAJECTORY** (`synthomnicon/trajectory.py`):
   - `TemporalSynthonAgent` — encode D_∞ systems as step sequences, validate Axiom 6 compliance
   - Three checks: S mass balance, Axiom 4 (D_∞ or R_‡), K_trap/ΔG‡>100
   - CLI: `syncon trajectory validate --steps <names> --reset <name>`

3. **SYNTHONIC_ENSEMBLER** (`synthomnicon/ensembler.py`):
   - `EnsembleCatalog` — N×N pairwise compatibility, emergent property detection, system ξ_CP
   - Emergent: criticality, G_ב→G_ג amplification (Axiom 3), interface fidelity degradation
   - CLI: `syncon ensemble check --components <names>`

4. **SYNTHONIC_RETRODESIGN** (`synthomnicon/retrodesign.py`):
   - `RetrodesignEngine.decompose()` — recursive axiom-pruned decomposition tree
   - Axioms 1, 2 (sub-tuples claiming G_ℵ only), 4, 6
   - CLI: `syncon retrodesign <name_or_notation> --max-depth 3 --prune-axioms 1,2,4,6`

See **Section 7** for full protocol API documentation and CLI reference. See **Section 8** for the tuple algebra commands.

### What's New in v0.3.5?

**Phase 3a DSL + Agent Fixes + Topology Symbols** (March 16, 2026):

1. **`.syn` YAML DSL** (`synthomnicon/syn_runner.py`): Design programs compiled to `SynthonM` pipelines. Supported step types: `join`, `meet`, `tensor`, `lift`, `path`, `assert`, `bind`, `or`. The `or:` step implements MonadPlus fallback (`strategy_or`). Post-hoc `output: assert:` block checks WriterT-level cost (`total_delta_xi < N`, `steps <= N`, `criticality_ok`).

2. **`syncon run <file.syn>`**: New CLI command. `--format text|json`, `--save PATH`, `--dry-run`. Runs `.syn` scripts and reports step-by-step trace plus output assertions.

3. **Agent primitive awareness**: Both `axiom_guided_generator` and `synthon_generator_agent` now declare **ten primitives** (D, T, R, P, F, K, G, Γ, Φ, S). `criticality_phase` parser defaults to `Phi_sub` instead of returning `None`. Topology block lists all 7 values with symbols.

4. **New topology symbols**: Three acyclic connectivity classes now have explicit symbols:
   - `T_|` (LINEAR) — unbranched linear chain, no junction nodes
   - `T_⊥` (BRANCHED) — branched acyclic, one or more junction nodes
   - `T_∈` (NETWORK) — multiply-connected, cycles permitted without cage closure
   All three are registered in `Topology.from_symbol()`.

5. **Notation always includes Φ**: `to_notation()` defaults to `Phi_sub` when `criticality_phase` is unset; S appended as 10th position when set. Notation is always a 9- or 10-element tuple.

### What's New in v0.3.3?

**Experimental Validation Suite + Factor 7 + F_ℓ Activation** (March 16, 2026):

1. **CB[7] competitive displacement — 6/6 HotSwap validation**: Three-tier CB[7] series (Fc/Ad/DABCO) tests the F-floor asymmetric ratchet against Kim JACS 2001 / Assaf & Nau CSR 2015 experimental data. All 6 directional predictions (3 APPROVED, 3 BLOCKED) match experiment from ordinal F ranking alone. First use of **F_ℓ tier** (DABCO, Ka = 2×10⁵ M⁻¹ < threshold ~10⁷ M⁻¹).

2. **Factor 7 — Frank-model classical bifurcation** (`varma_probe.py`): New heuristic factor (weight 0.25) in `score_phi_c_candidacy()`. Fires when D_∞ + T_⋈ + P_directional + F_ℏ are co-present. Identifies pitchfork bifurcation at ee = 0 (Frank 1953) — universality class distinct from Varma QXY and steric-cliff.

3. **Soai reaction catalog entry** (`soai_pyrimidyl_autocatalytic_cycle`): Fully grounded. ξ_r = 15, ξ_τ = 7.2×10¹⁵ (ω_c = 10¹² s⁻¹), ratio = 0.94. Probe score **0.920** (approaching Φ_c, Frank-model mechanism). Highest-confidence Φ_c candidate in catalog.

4. **Proline-aldol Varma probe**: ξ_r = 6.2, ξ_τ = 1.8×10¹⁴, ratio = 0.189 → Φ_sub confirmed. The 60 Å correlation length required for criticality is incompatible with the observed enamine geometry.

5. **Three-mechanism discrimination** — probe now discriminates three universality classes:
   - Varma QXY (Factors 1–5)
   - Steric-cliff proxy (Factor 6, db24c8 score 0.461)
   - Frank-model classical bifurcation (Factor 7, Soai score 0.920)

### What's New in v0.3.2?

**Tuple Algebra + Compositional Design Language** (March 16, 2026):

1. **Lattice operations** — `syncon meet S1 S2` and `syncon join S1 S2`. Componentwise min/max on ordered primitives; CONFLICT sentinel on categorical mismatch; Φ_c dominates in both.
2. **Path search** — `syncon path SRC DST`. BFS over valid-swap directed graph restricted to same {D,T} cluster; accumulates Δξ_CP; correctly asymmetric (F-floor enforcement).
3. **Tensor product** — `syncon tensor S1 S2`. Ensemble prediction: F→min (bottleneck), K→min, G→max, Φ_c propagates, ξ_ens = ξ₁+ξ₂−λ·I(s₁;s₂).
4. **Natural transformations** — `syncon lift NAME (temporal|spatial|critical|molecular)`. Four primitive-rewriting maps with side-by-side diff output. Criticality lift gated on F≥F_ℏ (Axiom 5 enforcement).
5. **DesignPipeline** — `syncon pipeline START --step op:arg [...]`. Writer+Maybe monad: chained operations with automatic ξ_CP threading and fail-fast logging. Equivalent to Haskell do-notation over the HotSwap category.

See **Section 8** for full reference.

### What's New in v2.2?

**I(bits) Calibration + Quantitative Criticality + Stoichiometry** (March 2026):

1. **Calibrated I(bits) pipeline** — DOF-counting replaces 4–6 bit heuristic (new range: 6–18 bits). `syncon info-bits --calibrate [--solvent chloroform|THF|DMSO|water]`.
2. **Quantitative criticality probe** — z_eff divergence measure + degeneracy strength score (0–1, four tiers). `syncon criticality-probe --batch --degeneracy-type --export-candidates`.
3. **Stoichiometry primitive S** — 10th primitive with weight 0.08 in similarity scoring. `syncon catalog auto-stoichiometry` backfills T_⋈ entries. Pass 4 audit enforces S consistency.
4. **Analogy enhancements** — `syncon analogies --critical-only` and `--stoichiometry-aware` flags.
5. **Fidelity tier boundaries updated** — HIGH ≤ 8.5 nats · MEDIUM 8.5–11.0 nats · LOW > 11.0 nats (was 9.0/11.5).

### What's New in v2.1?

**SYNTHONICON_FIXES.md Full Implementation** (March 14–15, 2026):

1. **Grounding Validation with Registration Blocking** (Fix 1 — CRITICAL):
   - `--strict-grounding` flag blocks registration if primitives lack mechanistic grounding
   - `--override-grounding` with `--override-reason` for speculative entries
   - `--speculative` flag registers into isolated 'speculative' domain
   - Audit trail logs all grounding overrides with human-provided justifications
   - Grounding metadata persisted in catalog JSON

2. **Axiom 6: Temporal Grounding** (Fix 2 — HIGH, extended v0.3.3):
   - D_∞ requires either a named discrete reset OR a continuously supplied dissipative flux (see below)
   - **Discrete reset** (`reset_type="discrete"`): validates `cycle_steps` ≥ 2, or `axiom6_grounding` block with `initial_state`, `transformation`, `work_performed`, `reset_mechanism`
   - **Continuous dissipative** (`reset_type="continuous"`): validates `driving_gradient.description` and `driving_gradient.coupling` in `synthon.grounding["reset"]`
   - Keyword scan (`AXIOM_6_RESET_INDICATORS`, `AXIOM_6_PROCESS_INDICATORS`) is fallback only when no structured block is present

3. **Axiom 7: Cyclic Topology Grounding** (Fix 3 — HIGH):
   - T_⋈ now requires named closing bond/interaction
   - Detects invalid justifications (linear, rod, chain, axial, etc.)
   - Keyword indicators: `AXIOM_7_CLOSING_INDICATORS`, `AXIOM_7_INVALID_TOPO_KEYWORDS`

4. **Per-Primitive Confidence** (Fix 4 — MEDIUM):
   - `PrimitiveGrounding` dataclass: `confidence: float`, `is_grounded: bool`, `failure_reason`, `suggested_alternative`
   - `ADVERSARIAL_GROUNDING_PROMPT` — challenges each primitive from first principles
   - Confidence auto-derived from status (GROUNDED=0.9, AMBIGUOUS=0.5, UNGROUNDED=0.1, INVALID=0.0)

5. **Quantum Extension Quarantine** (Fix 5 — MEDIUM):
   - `domain` field tags speculative/quantum entries
   - Prevents semantic contamination of grounded catalog

6. **Catalog Audit Command** (Fix 6 — MEDIUM):
   - `syncon audit` scans catalog for grounding issues
   - Axiom 6/7 shortcuts, `--auto-flag`, `--dry-run` support (see Section 4.2)

7. **NLP Format Enforcement** (v2.1.3):
   - All LLM prompts across the codebase follow NLP_FORMAT.md
   - XML tags, `**MUST**`/`**MUST NOT**`, declarative commands, explicit output formats

**Eight Axioms Now Enforced**:
- Axioms 1-5: Composition axioms (QUANTSYNTHONICON.md Section IV)
- Axioms 6-7: Grounding axioms (SYNTHONICON_FIXES.md)
- Axiom 8: R physics match (R must match actual interaction physics)

SynthOmnicon is a groundbreaking Python framework that brings the theoretical elegance of the **Unified Synthonicon** to practical application. At its core, SynthOmnicon provides a computational platform for systematically analyzing, designing, and predicting the behavior of self-organizing chemical systems. It unifies disparate fields—from traditional molecular organic chemistry to complex supramolecular assemblies and dynamic temporal processes—under a single, coherent conceptual umbrella.

The framework's primary goal is to bridge the understanding gap between these domains by employing a shared language: the **Ten Primitives** (Dimensionality, Topology, Recognition Mode, Polarity, Fidelity, Kinetic Character, Granularity, Interaction Grammar, Criticality Phase, and Stoichiometry). This unified notation allows researchers and developers to describe any self-organizing chemical motif, regardless of its scale or mechanism, with unprecedented precision.

**Key Benefits of SynthOmnicon:**

*   **Unified Language:** Provides a common vocabulary for describing chemical systems across molecular, supramolecular, and temporal scales, fostering interdisciplinary insights.
*   **Predictive Power:** Enables the prediction of system behavior, compatibility, and efficiency based on the fundamental properties of its constituent synthons.
*   **Axiom Validation:** Automatically validates synthons against five composition axioms from QUANTSYNTHONICON.md Section IV.
*   **AI-Driven Design:** The discrete and quantifiable nature of its primitives makes SynthOmnicon an ideal foundation for AI and machine learning applications in chemical synthesis and materials discovery. By encoding chemical knowledge in a structured format, it facilitates generative design and autonomous chemical research.

### Core Philosophy: Synthons as Constraint Propagation Units

At the heart of SynthOmnicon lies the concept of a **Synthon** as a "constraint propagation unit." Traditionally, synthons were idealized fragments used in retrosynthetic analysis. SynthOmnicon extends this definition: a Synthon is understood as a minimal subsystem that **encodes a specific set of constraints**. When this synthon interacts with a compatible environment via a defined recognition mode, it actively *reduces the system's degrees of freedom*. This reduction reliably steers the overall system towards a predictable target state—be it a specific molecular connectivity, a complex supramolecular geometry, or a precise temporal sequence.

This information-theoretic perspective positions synthons not merely as static building blocks, but as dynamic agents that guide assembly and transformation by influencing the probabilistic landscape of chemical outcomes. In essence, synthons act as local rules that propagate their influence globally, analogous to constraint propagation algorithms in computer science, where local rules reduce a vast search space to a manageable set of solutions.

### The Ten Primitives: A Unified Language

The Unified Synthonicon is built upon ten primitives, each representing a crucial aspect of a synthon's behavior and function. These primitives form a standardized, extensible vocabulary:

| Primitive                 | Symbol              | Description                                                  | Key Purpose in SynthOmnicon                                   |
| :------------------------ | :------------------ | :----------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Dimensionality**        | $D$ ($D_{\wedge}, D_{\bigtriangleup}, D_{\infty}$) | The coordinate set along which the synthon operates.         | Defines the operational scale (molecular, supramolecular, temporal). |
| **Topology**              | $T$ ($T_{\bowtie}, T_{\ggg}, T_{\square}, T_{\square\square}, T_{|}, T_{\perp}, T_{\in}$) | The internal connectivity pattern of the synthon's minimal motif. | Characterizes structural arrangements (cyclic, chain, hub/node, cage, linear, branched, network). |
| **Recognition Mode**      | $R$ ($R_{\subseteq}, R_{\supseteq}, R_{\ddagger}, R_{\Leftrightarrow}$) | The physical mechanism of interaction.                       | Specifies how synthons interact (covalent, non-covalent, dynamic). |
| **Polarity**              | $P$ ($P+, P-, P_{\pm}$) | The directional character of the interaction.                | Dictates partner preference and orientation (acceptor, donor, self-complementary). |
| **Fidelity**              | $F$ ($F_{\hbar}, F_{\eth}, F_{\ell}$) | Thermodynamic reliability anchored to $\xi_{CP}$. Tiers: HIGH ≤ 8.5 nats · MEDIUM 8.5–11.0 nats · LOW > 11.0 nats. | Quantifies the predictability and robustness of an interaction. |
| **Kinetic Character**     | $K$ ($K_{\text{fast}}, K_{\text{mod}}, K_{\text{slow}}, K_{\text{trap}}$) | Activation barrier and pathway multiplicity. | Distinguishes thermodynamic fidelity from operational accessibility. |
| **Granularity**           | $G$ ($G_{\beth}, G_{\gimel}, G_{\aleph}$) | The scale of control exerted by the synthon.                 | Defines the scope of influence (local, mesoscale, global).    |
| **Interaction Grammar**   | $\Gamma$ ($\Gamma_{\wedge}, \Gamma_{\vee}, \Gamma_{\to}$) × (SPECIFIC · SELECTIVE · BROAD) | The logic governing partner selection.                       | Determines the specificity and ordering of binding. |
| **Criticality Phase**     | $\Phi$ ($\Phi_{\text{sub}}, \Phi_c, \Phi_{\text{super}}$) | Phase relative to the G–D criticality locus. | Encodes whether the synthon exhibits scale-free behavior (Axiom 5). |
| **Stoichiometry**         | $S$ (e.g. `"1:1"`, `"2:1"`, `"n:m"`) | Valency ratio of the recognition event; constrains T and P. Weight 0.08 in analogy scoring. | Distinguishes homodimers from host–guest and polymeric assemblies. |

Together, these primitives are used to generate the full **Unified Notation**: `⟨D; T; R; P; F; K; G; Γ; Φ; S⟩`. This notation is the cornerstone of SynthOmnicon, enabling quantitative analysis and cross-domain comparisons.

## 2. Installation and Setup

To begin using the SynthOmnicon framework, follow these steps to set up your Python environment and install the necessary dependencies.

### Prerequisites

*   **Python Version**: SynthOmnicon requires Python 3.9 or higher.
    *   To check your Python version, run: `python --version` or `python3 --version`.
    *   If you need to install Python, visit [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
*   **Operating System**: The framework is developed and tested on Linux environments, but should generally work on macOS and Windows (using WSL for a better experience on Windows).
*   **Internet Connection**: Required for downloading dependencies.

### Recommended Environment Management

It is highly recommended to use a virtual environment to manage project dependencies. This isolates the project's packages from your system-wide Python installation, preventing conflicts and ensuring reproducibility. Two excellent tools for this are `uv` (faster, modern alternative) or `venv` (standard Python module).

### Installation Steps

#### Option 1: Using `uv` (Recommended for Speed and Efficiency)

`uv` is a new, highly performant Python package installer and resolver. If you don't have `uv` installed, you can get it with `pip`:

```bash
pip install uv
```

Once `uv` is installed, navigate to your SynthOmnicon project directory and follow these commands:

1.  **Create a virtual environment**:
    ```bash
    uv venv
    ```
    This creates a new virtual environment named `.venv` in your project root.

2.  **Activate the virtual environment**:
    *   **On Linux/macOS**:
        ```bash
        source .venv/bin/activate
        ```
    *   **On Windows (Git Bash/WSL)**:
        ```bash
        source .venv/bin/activate
        ```
    *   **On Windows (Command Prompt)**:
        ```bash
        .venv\Scripts\activate.bat
        ```
    *   **On Windows (PowerShell)**:
        ```bash
        .venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
        ```
    Your command prompt should now show `(.venv)` prefixed, indicating the virtual environment is active.

3.  **Install project dependencies**:
    ```bash
    uv pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    `uv` will quickly install all packages listed in `requirements.txt`.

#### Option 2: Using `pip` and `venv` (Standard Python)

If you prefer to use the standard Python tools, `venv` and `pip` are readily available.

1.  **Create a virtual environment**:
    ```bash
    python -m venv .venv
    ```
    This creates a new virtual environment named `.venv` in your project root.

2.  **Activate the virtual environment**:
    *   **On Linux/macOS**:
        ```bash
        source .venv/bin/activate
        ```
    *   **On Windows (Git Bash/WSL)**:
        ```bash
        source .venv/bin/activate
        ```
    *   **On Windows (Command Prompt)**:
        ```bash
        .venv\Scripts\activate.bat
        ```
    *   **On Windows (PowerShell)**:
        ```bash
        .venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
        ```
    Your command prompt should now show `(.venv)` prefixed, indicating the virtual environment is active.

3.  **Install project dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    `pip` will install all packages listed in `requirements.txt`.

### Verifying Installation

After installing dependencies, you can run the integration tests to verify that everything is set up correctly:

```bash
python test_integration.py
```

You should see a message indicating that all tests passed. If any tests fail, please refer to the "Troubleshooting" section or create an issue in the project repository.

### Project Structure Overview

The SynthOmnicon framework is organized into several key directories:

*   `synthomnicon/`: Contains the core Python modules for the Unified Synthonicon, including primitive definitions, the Synthon dataclass, catalog, constraints engine, and thermodynamics calculations.
*   `synthomnicon/domains/`: Houses domain-specific agents (molecular, supramolecular, temporal, hybrid) that leverage the core framework for specialized analyses.
*   `framework/`: Includes components of the underlying AjintK multi-agent framework, providing utilities for agent orchestration and communication.
*   `examples/`: Demonstrative scripts showing how to use various parts of SynthOmnicon.
*   `QUANTSYNTHONICON.md`: The foundational theoretical document detailing the Unified Synthonicon.
*   `README.md`: General project information and quick start guide.
*   `requirements.txt`: Lists all Python dependencies.

The Unified Synthonicon framework categorizes the fundamental properties of chemical interactions into ten primitives. Primitives 1–9 are encoded as Python `Enum` classes; primitive 10 (S, Stoichiometry) is a string field with category-aware similarity grading and Pass 4 audit enforcement. Together they form the standardized language for describing, comparing, and predicting synthon behavior across molecular, supramolecular, and temporal domains.

### 3.1. Dimensionality (D)

Dimensionality specifies the coordinate set or "space" along which a synthon primarily operates. It helps define the context and scale of the chemical system under consideration. The `Dimensionality` enum can also represent hybrid systems that span multiple domains.

*   **Enum Members**:
    *   `MOLECULAR` (`"D_wedge"` or `"D_∧"`): Point-like reactivity, typically involving individual atoms or small molecules.
    *   `SUPRAMOLECULAR` (`"D_triangle"` or `"D_△"`): Three-dimensional spatial organization, such as crystal packing or host-guest interactions.
    *   `TEMPORAL` (`"D_infinity"` or `"D_∞"`): One-dimensional periodicity over time, characteristic of oscillating reactions or catalytic cycles.
    *   `HYBRID_MOL_SUPRA` (`"D_wedge_triangle"`): Combines molecular-level reactions within a supramolecular framework.
    *   `HYBRID_MOL_TEMP` (`"D_wedge_infinity"`): Molecular reactions with a temporal component (e.g., dynamic covalent chemistry).
    *   `HYBRID_SUPRA_TEMP` (`"D_triangle_infinity"`): Supramolecular structures exhibiting temporal dynamics.
    *   `HYBRID_ALL` (`"D_all"`): Spans all three fundamental dimensions.

*   **Usage Examples**:
    ```python
    from synthomnicon.models import Dimensionality

    # Accessing enum members
    mol_dim = Dimensionality.MOLECULAR
    print(f"Molecular Dimensionality: {mol_dim.value}")

    # Parsing from symbolic notation
    temp_dim = Dimensionality.from_symbol("D_∞")
    print(f"Temporal Dimensionality from symbol: {temp_dim.name}")

    # Hybrid example
    hybrid_dim = Dimensionality.HYBRID_MOL_SUPRA
    print(f"Hybrid Dimensionality: {hybrid_dim.value}")
    ```

*   **`domains` Property**:
    Each `Dimensionality` member has a `domains` property, which returns a `Set[str]` indicating the fundamental domains it encompasses (e.g., "molecular", "supramolecular", "temporal").

    ```python
    print(f"Domains for HYBRID_MOL_SUPRA: {hybrid_dim.domains}")
    # Expected: {'molecular', 'supramolecular'}
    print(f"Domains for TEMPORAL: {temp_dim.domains}")
    # Expected: {'temporal'}
    ```

### 3.2. Topology (T)

Topology describes the internal connectivity pattern or spatial arrangement within the synthon's minimal motif. It characterizes the geometric scaffolding or network structure formed by the interacting components.

*   **Enum Members**:
    *   `CYCLIC_BOWTIE` (`"T_bowtie"` or `"T_⋈"`): Cyclic motifs, like hydrogen-bonded dimers (e.g., carboxylic acid dimer) or catalytic cycles.
    *   `CHAIN` (`"T_chains"` or `"T_≫"`): Linear or extended chain structures (e.g., polymers, protein helices).
    *   `HUB_NODE` (`"T_square"` or `"T_□"`): Central nodes connecting multiple branches, common in metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) or dendritic structures.
    *   `LINEAR` (`"T_linear"` / `"T_|"`): Unbranched linear chain, no junction nodes (e.g., linear polymers, rod-like coordination chains).
    *   `BRANCHED` (`"T_branched"` / `"T_⊥"`): Branched acyclic topology with one or more junction nodes (e.g., dendrimers, branched polymers).
    *   `NETWORK` (`"T_network"` / `"T_∈"`): Multiply-connected, cycles permitted but without full 3D cage closure (e.g., MOF nets, 2D coordination networks). Use a sub-label when ring topology is known:
        *   `NETWORK_HEX` (`"T_network_hex"` / `"T_∈(hex)"`): 6-membered rings only (e.g., ice Ih, honeycomb MOFs, graphene-like nets). Complexity 5.
        *   `NETWORK_MIXED` (`"T_network_mixed"` / `"T_∈(mixed)"`): Mixed ring sizes (e.g., ice III, ice IV, ice V). Complexity 5.
        *   `NETWORK_INTERPENETRATING` (`"T_network_interp"` / `"T_∈(×2)"`): Two independent sub-networks occupying the same space (e.g., ice VI, ice VII, ice VIII — bcc interpenetrating H-bond lattices). Complexity 6.
        *   `NETWORK_SYM` (`"T_network_sym"` / `"T_∈(sym)"`): Centrosymmetric bonding — symmetric H-bond or equivalent (e.g., ice X at ≥70 GPa). Complexity 5.
    *   `CAGE` (`"T_cage"` / `"T_□□"`): Fully enclosed, hollow structures — 3D closure required (e.g., cucurbiturils, Fujita spheres, COCs).
    *   `BOWL` (`"T_bowl"` / `"T_∪"`): Open concave cavity with a single portal — guest enters and exits freely; K_fast is the default (e.g., calixarenes, resorcinarenes, pillar[n]arenes, cyclotriveratrylenes). Distinguished from T_□□ by the absence of full 3D closure: T_∪ → T_□□ is non-conservative (changes kinetic regime). *Identified through catalog self-audit in v0.3.6.*
    *   `BRAID` (`"T_braid"` / `"T_↗↙"`): **NEW in v0.4.0.** Anyonic/braided exchange statistics — the topology of braid groups, not spatial connectivity. Encodes systems where particle exchange is described by non-abelian braid operations rather than simple permutations (Z₂ for bosons/fermions). `tensor(T_braid, T_braid) → T_braid` (anyonic statistics preserved). `T_braid ⊓ T_linear = ⊥` (no classical topology sits below both). Complexity 4. Physical systems: fractional quantum Hall states (ν=1/3, ν=5/2), Kitaev honeycomb B-phase, non-abelian Majorana platforms. *Identified as missing from the T lattice via quantum particle encoding (v0.4.0).*

*   **Usage Examples**:
    ```python
    from synthomnicon.models import Topology

    cyclic_topo = Topology.CYCLIC_BOWTIE
    print(f"Cyclic Topology: {cyclic_topo.value}")

    # Accessing from symbol
    hub_topo = Topology.from_symbol("T_□")
    print(f"Hub-Node Topology from symbol: {hub_topo.name}")
    ```

*   **`complexity` Property**:
    The `complexity` property returns an integer score (1-5) reflecting the topological intricacy, where higher values indicate more complex arrangements.

    ```python
    print(f"Complexity of CYCLIC_BOWTIE: {cyclic_topo.complexity}")
    # Expected: 2
    print(f"Complexity of NETWORK: {Topology.NETWORK.complexity}")
    # Expected: 5
    ```

### 3.3. Recognition Mode (R)

Recognition Mode defines the specific physical mechanism by which synthons interact and recognize each other, enabling reliable propagation of information or structure.

*   **Enum Members**:
    *   `COVALENT` (`"R_subset"` or `"R_⊆"`): Involves the formation of strong, directional covalent bonds.
    *   `NON_COVALENT` (`"R_superset"` or `"R_⊇"`): Relies on weaker, reversible interactions like hydrogen bonds, van der Waals forces, or halogen bonds.
    *   `DYNAMIC_CATALYTIC` (`"R_dagger"` or `"R_‡"`): Encompasses interactions mediated by dynamic processes, often catalytic, leading to reversible bond formation or transformation.
    *   `MECHANICAL` (`"R_mechanical"` or `"R_⇔"`): Characterizes interlocked molecules (e.g., rotaxanes, catenanes) where components are physically linked but not covalently bonded.
    *   `COVALENT_DYNAMIC` (`"R_covalent_dynamic"` or `"R_⊆+‡"`): Hybrid mode for dynamic covalent chemistry, combining covalent bond formation with reversibility.

*   **Usage Examples**:
    ```python
    from synthomnicon.models import RecognitionMode

    non_covalent_mode = RecognitionMode.NON_COVALENT
    print(f"Non-Covalent Recognition Mode: {non_covalent_mode.value}")

    # Accessing from symbol
    dynamic_mode = RecognitionMode.from_symbol("R_‡")
    print(f"Dynamic Catalytic Mode from symbol: {dynamic_mode.name}")
    ```

*   **Properties**:
    *   `interaction_energy_range` (`Tuple[float, float]`): Returns a typical energy range (in kJ/mol) for interactions of this mode.
    *   `is_reversible` (`bool`): Indicates whether the interaction is typically reversible.

    ```python
    print(f"Energy range for COVALENT: {RecognitionMode.COVALENT.interaction_energy_range} kJ/mol")
    # Expected: (150.0, 500.0)
    print(f"Is NON_COVALENT reversible? {non_covalent_mode.is_reversible}")
    # Expected: True
    ```

### 3.4. Polarity (P)

Polarity captures the directional character of the interaction, dictating how components orient themselves and select partners. It relates to electron density distribution and reactivity.

*   **Enum Members**:
    *   `ACCEPTOR` (`"P_plus"` or `"P+"`): Electron-deficient site, acts as an electrophile or hydrogen bond acceptor.
    *   `DONOR` (`"P_minus"` or `"P-"`): Electron-rich site, acts as a nucleophile or hydrogen bond donor.
    *   `SELF_COMPLEMENTARY` (`"P_pm"` or `"P_±"`): Possesses both donor and acceptor characteristics that allow it to interact with identical motifs (e.g., carboxylic acid dimers).
    *   `DONOR_ACCEPTOR` (`"P_directional"` or `"P_+-"`): Combines donor and acceptor sites in a directional manner, forming specific D-A pairs.

*   **Usage Examples**:
    ```python
    from synthomnicon.models import Polarity

    acceptor_pol = Polarity.ACCEPTOR
    print(f"Acceptor Polarity: {acceptor_pol.value}")

    # Accessing from symbol
    self_comp_pol = Polarity.from_symbol("P_±")
    print(f"Self-Complementary Polarity from symbol: {self_comp_pol.name}")
    ```

*   **Methods**:
    *   `is_directional` (`bool`): Indicates if the polarity type implies inherent directionality.
    *   `is_compatible_with(other: Polarity)` (`bool`): Checks if two polarity types are compatible for interaction.

    ```python
    print(f"Is ACCEPTOR directional? {acceptor_pol.is_directional}")
    # Expected: True
    print(f"Is ACCEPTOR compatible with DONOR? {acceptor_pol.is_compatible_with(Polarity.DONOR)}")
    # Expected: True
    print(f"Is ACCEPTOR compatible with SELF_COMPLEMENTARY? {acceptor_pol.is_compatible_with(Polarity.SELF_COMPLEMENTARY)}")
    # Expected: False
    ```

### 3.5. Fidelity (F)

Fidelity provides a nuanced measure of a synthon's reliability, predictability, and robustness. It quantifies how consistently a synthon will perform its intended function under given conditions. Fidelity is domain-dependent and can be quantified differently (e.g., bond dissociation energy, interaction energy, fidelity per cycle).

*   **Enum Members**:
    *   `HIGH` (`"F_hbar"` or `"F_ℏ"`): Dominant, highly reliable, geometry-enforcing interactions. ξ_CP ≤ 8.5 nats. In supramolecular host–guest systems: Ka ≳ 10⁹ M⁻¹ (e.g., CB[7]·ferrocene-ammonium, Ka ≈ 3×10¹² M⁻¹). Represents strong constraint.
    *   `MEDIUM` (`"F_eth"` or `"F_ℇ"`): Context-dependent, robust but conditional interactions. ξ_CP 8.5–11.0 nats. Ka ~10⁷–10⁹ M⁻¹ (e.g., CB[7]·adamantane-ammonium, Ka ≈ 4×10⁸ M⁻¹).
    *   `LOW` (`"F_ell"` or `"F_ℓ"`): Probabilistic, competition-sensitive interactions, less reliable. ξ_CP > 11.0 nats. Ka ≲ 10⁷ M⁻¹ (e.g., CB[7]·DABCO, Ka ≈ 2×10⁵ M⁻¹). The F_ℓ tier boundary is anchored by the CB[7] competitive displacement series (Kim JACS 2001; v0.3.3).

*   **Usage Examples**:
    ```python
    from synthomnicon.models import Fidelity

    high_fidelity = Fidelity.HIGH
    print(f"High Fidelity: {high_fidelity.value}")

    # Accessing from symbol
    medium_fidelity = Fidelity.from_symbol("F_ℇ")
    print(f"Medium Fidelity from symbol: {medium_fidelity.name}")
    ```

*   **Properties**:
    *   `numeric_value` (`float`): Returns a standardized numeric value (0.0-1.0) for quantitative calculations.
    *   `xi_CP_range` (`Tuple[float, float]`): Provides the typical range for the Inefficiency Index ($\xi_{CP}$) associated with this fidelity level.

    ```python
    print(f"Numeric value for HIGH Fidelity: {high_fidelity.numeric_value}")
    # Expected: 0.95
    print(f"ξ_CP range for MEDIUM Fidelity: {medium_fidelity.xi_CP_range} nats")
    # Expected: (9.0, 11.5)
    ```

*   **`propagate_through(context_factors: Dict[str, float])` Method**:
    This method simulates how fidelity might change when exposed to various environmental or system-level context factors (e.g., `solvent_compatibility`, `temperature_match`, `steric_fit`, `concentration`).

    ```python
    context = {"solvent_compatibility": 0.8, "steric_fit": 0.9}
    propagated_fidelity = high_fidelity.propagate_through(context)
    print(f"Fidelity after propagation: {propagated_fidelity.name}")
    # Example output: MEDIUM (if context factors reduce effective fidelity)
    ```

### 3.6. Granularity (G)

Granularity defines the scale of control or influence exerted by the synthon within a larger system. It describes whether a synthon dictates organization locally, at an intermediate motif level, or globally across a network.

*   **Enum Members**:
    *   `LOCAL` (`"G_beth"` or `"G_ב"`): Control at a very confined scale, typically involving a single bond or interaction.
    *   `MESOSCALE` (`"G_gimel"` or `"G_ג"`): Control over a motif or small cluster of interactions (e.g., a specific binding pocket, a small oligomer).
    *   `GLOBAL` (`"G_aleph"` or `"G_א"`): Control that extends throughout an entire network or framework (e.g., a crystal lattice, a self-replicating system).

*   **Usage Examples**:
    ```python
    from synthomnicon.models import Granularity

    local_gran = Granularity.LOCAL
    print(f"Local Granularity: {local_gran.value}")

    # Accessing from symbol
    global_gran = Granularity.from_symbol("G_א")
    print(f"Global Granularity from symbol: {global_gran.name}")
    ```

*   **Properties**:
    *   `scale_factor` (`int`): Returns an approximate numerical factor representing the number of components controlled by this granularity level.

    ```python
    print(f"Scale factor for MESOSCALE: {Granularity.MESOSCALE.scale_factor}")
    # Expected: 100
    ```

*   **`can_amplify_to(target: Granularity)` Method**:
    Checks if the current granularity level can conceptually "amplify" its control to a specified target granularity level (i.e., local can amplify to mesoscale, mesoscale to global).

    ```python
    print(f"Can LOCAL amplify to GLOBAL? {local_gran.can_amplify_to(global_gran)}")
    # Expected: True
    print(f"Can GLOBAL amplify to LOCAL? {global_gran.can_amplify_to(local_gran)}")
    # Expected: False
    ```

### 3.7. Interaction Grammar ($\Gamma$)

Interaction Grammar governs the logic of partner selection for a synthon. It describes the specificity or promiscuity of its interactions, from highly selective binding to broad, non-specific recognition.

*   **Enum Members**:
    *   `SPECIFIC` (`"Gamma_otimes"` or `"Γ_⊗"`): Selects one highly specific partner, akin to a lock-and-key mechanism.
    *   `SELECTIVE` (`"Gamma_odot"` or `"Γ_⊙"`): Interacts with a small, defined set of partners (typically 3-10).
    *   `BROAD` (`"Gamma_bigcirc"` or `"Γ_○"`): Compatible with many potential partners, often leading to less predictable outcomes without additional constraints.
    *   Sequential variants (v0.3.5): `SPECIFIC_SEQ`, `SELECTIVE_SEQ`, `BROAD_SEQ` — same specificity tier but operating along a directed temporal axis (D_∞ systems). Registered as `"Γ_⊗_seq"`, `"Γ_⊙_seq"`, `"Γ_○_seq"`.
    *   **Dissipative variants (v0.4.0)**: `SPECIFIC_DISSIPATIVE`, `SELECTIVE_DISSIPATIVE`, `BROAD_DISSIPATIVE` — irreversible coupling governed by `Γ_↓(DISSIPATIVE)` operator (Lindblad/Zeno channel). Use for open quantum systems where the interaction causes information loss to the environment rather than unitary exchange. `specificity_score` = 0.95 / 0.75 / 0.25 respectively; `partner_count_range` = (1,1) / (1,3) / (1,∞).
    *   **Quantum tier (v0.4.0)**: `QUANTUM_AND`, `QUANTUM_OR`, `QUANTUM_SEQ`, `QUANTUM_DISSIPATIVE` — Toffoli-gate semantics operating on superposition states. `QUANTUM_AND` requires simultaneous entanglement of two control qubits; `QUANTUM_OR` is the logical OR of coherent pathways; `QUANTUM_SEQ` chains unitary gates preserving superposition; `QUANTUM_DISSIPATIVE` = measurement/decoherence channel. All quantum members share `partner_count_range = (1, 2)` and `specificity_score = 0.9`. *Identified as missing during quantum particle encoding — classical Γ values destroy superposition semantics (v0.4.0).*

*   **Usage Examples**:
    ```python
    from synthomnicon.models import InteractionGrammar

    specific_grammar = InteractionGrammar.SPECIFIC
    print(f"Specific Grammar: {specific_grammar.value}")

    # Accessing from symbol
    broad_grammar = InteractionGrammar.from_symbol("Γ_○")
    print(f"Broad Grammar from symbol: {broad_grammar.name}")
    ```

*   **Properties**:
    *   `partner_count_range` (`Tuple[int, int]`): Returns the typical range of compatible partners for this grammar.
    *   `specificity_score` (`float`): Provides a numerical score (0.0-1.0) indicating the degree of specificity, where 1.0 is most specific.

    ```python
    print(f"Partner count range for SELECTIVE: {InteractionGrammar.SELECTIVE.partner_count_range}")
    # Expected: (2, 10)
    print(f"Specificity score for BROAD: {broad_grammar.specificity_score}")
    # Expected: 0.1
    ```

### 3.8. Kinetic Character (K)

Kinetic Character encodes the activation barrier and pathway multiplicity for constraint propagation, independently of thermodynamic fidelity F. A synthon can be F_ℏ (high fidelity) but K_slow (kinetically inaccessible), or F_eth but K_fast.

*   **Enum Members**:
    *   `FAST` (`"K_fast"`): ΔG‡ < 60 kJ/mol; spontaneous on experimental timescales. Accessibility score: 0.95.
    *   `MODERATE` (`"K_mod"`): ΔG‡ ≈ 60–100 kJ/mol; accessible with mild activation. Accessibility score: 0.70.
    *   `SLOW` (`"K_slow"`): ΔG‡ > 100 kJ/mol; requires significant activation. Accessibility score: 0.30.
    *   `TRAP` (`"K_trap"`): Pathway multiplicity high; kinetic products diverge from thermodynamic products. Accessibility score: 0.50.
    *   `MBL` (`"K_MBL"`): **NEW in v0.4.0.** Many-body localization — disorder-induced kinetic arrest. The system is frozen not by an energy barrier but by the structure of its many-body eigenbasis; adding energy does not cause relaxation. Ordinal position 0 (below K_trap at 1) in the kinetic hierarchy — more arrested than any classical trap. Accessibility score: 0.05. Barrier range: (0.0, 0.0) — not barrier-limited. `meet(K_MBL, anything) → K_MBL`. **Cannot be inferred from `from_barrier()`**; requires explicit assignment. Physical systems: disordered quantum magnets, cold atoms in quasiperiodic potentials (Aubry-André model), many-body localized phases in 1D interacting systems. *Identified as missing via quantum particle encoding — K_trap is energy-barrier trapping, K_MBL is disorder trapping; the distinction matters because MBL stores quantum information indefinitely (v0.4.0).*

*   **Example usage**: The carboxylic acid homodimer is F_ℏ, K_fast. The gas-phase imine condensation proxy is F_eth, K_slow; aqueous imine is F_eth, K_mod — same thermodynamic tier, different operational accessibility.

### 3.9. Criticality Phase (Φ)

Criticality Phase encodes the synthon's position relative to the G–D criticality locus.

*   **Enum Members**:
    *   `SUBCRITICAL` (`"Phi_sub"`): G and D are demonstrably independent. Default assignment.
    *   `CRITICAL` (`"Phi_c"`): At the criticality locus — ξ→∞, scale-free behavior, G/D degenerate (Axiom 5).
    *   `SUPERCRITICAL` (`"Phi_super"`): Post-assembly state where synthon identity is absorbed into the assembled material.

*   **Criticality probe** (v2.2+): Use `syncon criticality-probe <name>` to score Φ_c candidacy. The probe now reports:
    *   `z_eff` — dynamic exponent (diverges logarithmically for Varma QXY class; = 1.33 for 2D percolation)
    *   Degeneracy strength score 0–1 with tier: `none` / `logarithmic` / `power-law` / `collapse`
    *   Universality class hint

    **Eight heuristic factors (v0.4.0):**

    | # | Trigger | Weight | Universality Class |
    |---|---------|--------|--------------------|
    | 1 | G_ℵ (global granularity) | 0.15 | Varma QXY |
    | 2 | D_∞ (temporal dimension) | 0.15 | Varma QXY |
    | 3 | T_⋈ (self-complementary) | 0.15 | Varma QXY |
    | 4 | P_± (symmetric polarity) | 0.15 | Varma QXY |
    | 5 | F_ℏ (quantum fidelity) | 0.15 | Varma QXY |
    | 6 | db24c8 steric-cliff analog | 0.10 | Steric-cliff |
    | 7 | D_∞ + T_⋈ + P_DA + F_ℏ | 0.25 | Frank-model (classical bifurcation) |
    | 8 | **G_ℵ + F_ℏ + K_trap + ¬D_∞** | **0.20** | **Quantum criticality (TFI/heavy-fermion)** |

    Factor 8 (v0.4.0) fires when a synthon simultaneously has global granularity, quantum fidelity, and trap-kinetics, but **lacks** D_∞ temporality — the signature of a quantum critical point without a classical order parameter. Falsifiable prediction: susceptibility χ(T→0) ~ T^{-γ}. *Identified as missing when probing the spin singlet and qubit synthons, whose criticality fingerprint is orthogonal to Factors 1–7.*

    ```bash
    syncon criticality-probe my_synthon --degeneracy-type
    syncon criticality-probe --batch --export-candidates top20.json
    ```

### 3.10. Stoichiometry (S)

Stoichiometry encodes the valency ratio of the recognition event — the molar ratio of partners in the assembled motif. It is a string field (not an Enum) with weight 0.08 in analogy similarity scoring (~6% of total) and hard-constraint enforcement via Pass 4 audit.

*   **Value format**: `"1:1"`, `"2:1"`, `"3:1"`, `"n:m"` (free-form ratio string), or `None` (unassigned).

*   **Consistency rules** (enforced by Pass 4 audit):
    *   `T_⋈ + S="1:1"` → must have P± (self-complementary polarity)
    *   `T_⋈ + S="n:m"` (n≠m) → must have Γ∨(BROAD) or T_network
    *   `T_⋈ + no S` → auto-suggested as `"1:1"` if P± present; otherwise flagged for manual review

*   **Auto-backfill**:
    ```bash
    # Assign S="1:1" to all T_⋈ + P± entries (dry run first)
    syncon catalog auto-stoichiometry --dry-run
    syncon catalog auto-stoichiometry
    # Result: 1,157/1,269 T_⋈ entries auto-fixed; 112 require manual review
    ```

*   **Similarity grading** in analogy scoring:
    | Case | Score |
    |------|-------|
    | Exact match | 1.00 |
    | Both symmetric (n:n) | 0.90 |
    | Both asymmetric (n≠m) | 0.90 |
    | Category mismatch, ratio diff < 0.5 | 0.70 |
    | Category mismatch, ratio diff ≥ 0.5 | 0.20–0.70 |

*   **Python**:
    ```python
    synthon = Synthon(name="my_dimer", ..., stoichiometry="1:1")
    print(synthon.stoichiometry)  # "1:1"
    ```

### 3.11. Topological Protection Index (Ω) — 11th Primitive (v0.4.0)

Ω encodes the Altland–Zirnbauer / K-theory topological classification of a synthon. It is an **optional field** that defaults to `None` for all classical (non-topological) synthons. When set, it appears as the 11th element of the tuple notation: `⟨…; S; Ω⟩`.

*   **Enum**: `TopoIndex` (importable from `synthomnicon`)

*   **Enum Members** (ordered by protection strength, ordinal 0→4):

    | Symbol | Value | Ordinal | Description | Physical Systems |
    |--------|-------|---------|-------------|-----------------|
    | `Ω_0` | `TopoIndex.TRIVIAL` | 0 | No topological protection; fully classical | Ordinary insulators, non-topological magnets |
    | `Ω_Z₂` | `TopoIndex.Z2` | 1 | ℤ₂ protection; time-reversal-symmetric TIs | 3D TIs (Bi₂Se₃), QSHI, Z₂ SPT phases |
    | `Ω_Z` | `TopoIndex.Z_CLASS` | 2 | ℤ classification; integer invariant | Integer QHE (σ_xy = ne²/h), Chern insulators |
    | `Ω_Ch` | `TopoIndex.CHERN` | 3 | Chern-number protection; broken time-reversal | Haldane model, magnetic TIs, anomalous QHE |
    | `Ω_NA` | `TopoIndex.NON_ABELIAN` | 4 | Non-Abelian anyonic statistics; braided exchange | Kitaev honeycomb, Moore-Read FQH (ν=5/2), Majorana platforms |

*   **Lattice semantics**:
    *   `meet(Ω_a, Ω_b) → Ω_min` — conservative guarantee: use the weaker protection class when two systems couple
    *   `join(Ω_a, Ω_b) → Ω_max` — capability ceiling: higher class can host everything the lower class can
    *   `tensor(Ω_a, Ω_b) → Ω_max` — composite system inherits the stronger topological protection

*   **Distance weight**: 0.7 in `tuple_distance()` — Ω contributes ~5.7% of total distance (weight 0.7 out of default total ≈12.3).

*   **Usage**:
    ```python
    from synthomnicon import TopoIndex, Synthon

    kitaev_chain = Synthon(
        name="kitaev_chain",
        ...,
        topo_index=TopoIndex.NON_ABELIAN,   # Ω_NA — Majorana edge modes
    )

    print(kitaev_chain.topo_index.protection_strength)  # 4
    print(kitaev_chain.topo_index.physical_systems)
    # → 'Kitaev honeycomb, Moore-Read FQH (ν=5/2), Majorana platforms'
    print(kitaev_chain.to_notation())
    # → ⟨...; Ω_NA⟩
    ```

*   **`syncon analyze` display** (when Ω is set):
    ```
    Ω (TopoIndex)   Ω_NA   Non-Abelian anyonic · protection_strength=4
    ```

*   *Identified as missing when encoding the five quantum particle synthons (photon/proton/electron/spin/qubit). The framework had no way to distinguish a trivially gapped insulator from a topological insulator or non-Abelian fractional QH state — the distinction is operationally essential for quantum information protection arguments (v0.4.0).*

## 4. Command Line Interface (CLI)

SynthOmnicon provides a powerful command-line interface for rapid analysis and exploration of synthons. The CLI is accessible via `main.py` or the `synthomnicon` command (if installed as a package).

### 4.1. Core Commands

#### `analyze`
Analyze a synthon by its name or a raw notation string.

**Usage:**
```bash
python3 main.py analyze [IDENTIFIER]
```

**Example:**
```bash
python3 main.py analyze carboxylic_acid_dimer
```

#### `catalog list`
List all synthons currently registered in the global catalog.

**Usage:**
```bash
python3 main.py catalog list [--domain DOMAIN]
```

**Example:**
```bash
python3 main.py catalog list --domain temporal
```

#### `thermo`
Calculate thermodynamic metrics ($\eta_{CP}$ and $\xi_{CP}$) for a registered synthon.

**Usage:**
```bash
python3 main.py thermo [IDENTIFIER] --delta-g [KJ_MOL]
```

**Example:**
```bash
python3 main.py thermo carboxylic_acid_dimer --delta-g -12.0
```

#### `check`
Check the compatibility between two synthons.

**Usage:**
```bash
python3 main.py check [SYNTHON_A] [SYNTHON_B]
```

**Example:**
```bash
python3 main.py check enolate_synthon carbonyl_synthon
```

### 4.2. Catalog Audit Command

The `syncon audit` command runs a 4-pass scan of the catalog for grounding issues, topology errors, attractor-tuple contamination, and stoichiometry inconsistencies.

**Pass summary:**
| Pass | Axiom | Checks |
|------|-------|--------|
| 1 | Axiom 6 | D_∞ entries: structured grounding["reset"] block checked first (discrete or continuous); falls back to keyword scan |
| 2 | Axiom 7 | T_⋈ entries for named closing bond; rejects linear/rod/chain |
| 3 | — | Attractor-tuple contamination (≥7/7 match, no stored reasoning) |
| 4 *(v2.2)* | — | S consistency: T_⋈[1:1]↔P±; T_⋈[n:m]↔Γ∨BROAD/T_network |

**Usage:**
```bash
syncon audit [OPTIONS]
```

**Options:**

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `--axiom 6` | Audit all D_∞ entries for Axiom 6 (discrete reset or continuous dissipative flux) |
| `--axiom 7` | Audit all T_⋈ entries for Axiom 7 (named closing bond) |
| `--axiom 4` *(v2.2)* | Audit T_⋈ entries for stoichiometry consistency (Pass 4) |
| `--primitive D/T/R/...` | Filter by primitive type |
| `--value TEXT` | Filter by primitive value (e.g. `temporal`, `cyclic`) |
| `--status STATUS` | Filter by grounding status (unverified, partial, override, full, flagged_for_review) |
| `--auto-flag` | Set `grounding_status="flagged_for_review"` on problem entries |
| `--dry-run` | Preview what would be flagged without making changes |

**Examples:**

```bash
# Audit all D_∞ entries for closed-cycle grounding
syncon audit --axiom 6

# Audit all T_⋈ entries and auto-flag those without closing bond
syncon audit --axiom 7 --auto-flag

# Preview unverified entries without making changes
syncon audit --status unverified --dry-run

# Find all temporal entries with partial grounding
syncon audit --primitive D --value temporal --status partial

# Full audit: all unverified entries across catalog
syncon audit --status unverified --auto-flag
```

**Understanding the output:**

The command prints a Rich table with columns:
- **Synthon** — catalog entry name
- **Domain** — molecular / supramolecular / temporal / speculative
- **Grounding Status** — full / partial / override / unverified / flagged_for_review
- **Failed Primitives** — primitives that failed grounding checks
- **Flag Reason** — why the entry was flagged (grounding status or axiom check)

**Axiom 6 check logic (updated v0.3.3 — discrete/continuous):**

The audit calls `AxiomValidator.validate_axiom6_temporal_grounding(synthon)` which checks in priority order:

1. **Structured block** — `synthon.grounding["reset"]` (persisted in catalog JSON, survives reload):
   - `type = "discrete"`: requires `cycle_steps` list ≥ 2, **or** `axiom6_grounding` metadata block
   - `type = "continuous"`: requires `driving_gradient.description` + `driving_gradient.coupling`
2. **Keyword scan fallback** — only when no structured block exists. Scans description/reasoning for `AXIOM_6_RESET_INDICATORS` + `AXIOM_6_PROCESS_INDICATORS`; both must be present.

**Adding structured Axiom 6 grounding to a catalog entry:**

```python
from synthomnicon import global_catalog

s = global_catalog.get("my_dissipative_synthon")

# Continuous (dissipative, far-from-equilibrium):
s.grounding["reset"] = {
    "type": "continuous",
    "driving_gradient": {
        "description": "Continuous reagent supply (fuel + substrate) drives steady-state turnover",
        "coupling": "Chemical potential gradient: fuel → product, with autocatalytic product feedback",
        "entropy_export": "Heat dissipation to solvent; byproduct efflux",
    },
    "termination_condition": "Reagent depletion ends the cycle; no sharp reset event.",
}

# Discrete (closed cycle with explicit reset step):
s.grounding["reset"] = {
    "type": "discrete",
    "cycle_steps": [
        "Step 1: catalyst activates substrate",
        "Step 2: product formed",
        "Step 3: hydrolysis/relaxation returns catalyst to initial state (reset)",
    ],
}

global_catalog.save_catalog()
```

**Known grounded entries (v0.3.3):**

| Entry | Reset type | Mechanism |
|-------|-----------|-----------|
| `soai_pyrimidyl_autocatalytic_cycle` | `continuous` | iPr₂Zn + aldehyde flux; Frank-model bifurcation |
| `proline_aldol_cycle` | `discrete` | Iminium hydrolysis → free proline reset |

**Axiom 7 check logic:**
Scans the description for `AXIOM_7_CLOSING_INDICATORS` (e.g. "hydrogen bond", "ring", "macrocycle") and rejects if `AXIOM_7_INVALID_TOPO_KEYWORDS` are found (e.g. "linear", "rod", "allene").

### 4.3. I(bits) Calibration Command *(v2.2)*

```bash
# Run full calibration pipeline (vacuum)
syncon info-bits --calibrate

# With solvent correction
syncon info-bits --calibrate --solvent chloroform
syncon info-bits --calibrate --solvent water

# Single synthon
syncon info-bits carboxylic_acid_dimer
syncon info-bits triple_hbond_array --solvent THF
```

**Output fields:** `I_recognition`, `I_orientation` (overhead), `I_net = I_rec − 0.3×I_orient`, `I_total+solvent`, `ΔS_conf`, heuristic comparison, verdict.

**Calibrated ranges (v2.2):**
| System type | I_recognition |
|-------------|---------------|
| 2-HB dimers (acid dimer) | 9–10 bits |
| Cooperative arrays (triple H-bond DAD·ADA) | 14–18 bits |
| Quadruple arrays (AADD·DDAA) | 19–24 bits |
| Temporal cycles (proline aldol) | 6–9 bits/turn |

### 4.4. Criticality Probe Command *(v2.2 / updated v0.3.3)*

```bash
# Single entry
syncon criticality-probe my_synthon
syncon criticality-probe my_synthon --degeneracy-type

# With measured correlation lengths (Varma QXY test)
syncon criticality-probe my_synthon --xi-r 6.2 --xi-tau 1.8e14

# Batch mode: scan all Φ_c / T_⋈+D_∞ / steric-cliff candidacy entries
syncon criticality-probe --batch
syncon criticality-probe --batch --degeneracy-type
syncon criticality-probe --batch --export-candidates candidates.json
```

**Degeneracy tiers:**
| Score | Tier | Meaning |
|-------|------|---------|
| 0.00–0.30 | `none` | G and D independent |
| 0.30–0.60 | `logarithmic` | Varma QXY — ξ_r ≈ ln ξ_τ |
| 0.60–0.85 | `power-law` | Conventional QCP — finite z |
| 0.85–1.00 | `collapse` | Direct G/D identity |

**Scoring factors** (`score_phi_c_candidacy()`, `varma_probe.py`):

| Factor | Weight | Fires when | Universality class |
|--------|--------|------------|--------------------|
| 1–5 (Varma QXY structural heuristics) | 0.35 / 0.25 / 0.20 / ... | D_∞, R_‡, G_ג primitives present | Varma QXY (quantum) |
| 6 (Steric-cliff proxy) | 0.65 | `phi_c_candidacy.proxy_degeneracy_strength` ≥ 0.50 in grounding | Steric-cliff (mechanical) |
| 7 (Frank-model classical bifurcation) | 0.25 | D_∞ + T_⋈ + P_directional + F_ℏ all present | Frank 1953 (classical pitchfork) |

**Validated case studies (v0.3.3):**

| System | ξ_r | ξ_τ | Ratio | Score | Result |
|--------|-----|-----|-------|-------|--------|
| Soai autocatalytic cycle | 15 | 7.2×10¹⁵ | 0.94 | 0.920 | Approaching Φ_c (Frank model) |
| DB24C8 pseudorotaxane | — | — | — | 0.461 | Approaching Φ_c (steric cliff) |
| Proline-aldol cycle | 6.2 | 1.8×10¹⁴ | 0.189 | 0.380 | Φ_sub (subcritical, confirmed) |

**ω_c normalization note:** ξ_τ = τ_corr × ω_c where ω_c is the appropriate natural frequency for the system's relevant timescale. For solution-phase catalytic systems, use ω_c ≈ 10¹² s⁻¹ (solvent relaxation frequency) rather than kBT/h ≈ 6.25×10¹² s⁻¹ to avoid mixing molecular-vibration and macroscopic-catalytic timescales.

### 4.5. Stoichiometry Commands *(v2.2)*

```bash
# Auto-assign S="1:1" to T_⋈ + P± entries
syncon catalog auto-stoichiometry --dry-run   # preview
syncon catalog auto-stoichiometry             # apply (up to 500 entries)
syncon catalog auto-stoichiometry --limit 2000  # larger batch

# Analogy search with stoichiometry flags
syncon analogies my_synthon --stoichiometry-aware   # raises S weight to 0.12
syncon analogies my_synthon --critical-only          # pre-filter by Φ_c score > 0.5
syncon analogies my_synthon --stoichiometry-aware --critical-only
```

### 4.6. Experimental Validation Case Studies *(v0.3.3)*

#### CB[7] Competitive Displacement — F-floor Ratchet (6/6 Validated)

Tests the HotSwap `F`-floor hard constraint: a swap is BLOCKED if F_new < F_old. The CB[7] host-guest series provides a literature-grounded three-tier ordering.

```bash
# Register the three CB[7] complexes (already in catalog post-v0.3.3)
# CB7_ferrocene_ammonium_complex  (F_ℏ, Ka = 3×10¹², ΔG = -71.2 kJ/mol)
# CB7_adamantane_ammonium_complex (F_ℇ, Ka = 4.3×10⁸, ΔG = -49.1 kJ/mol)
# CB7_DABCO_complex               (F_ℓ, Ka = 2×10⁵, ΔG = -30.1 kJ/mol)

# Run all 6 directional swaps — expected: 3 APPROVED, 3 BLOCKED
syncon hotswap CB7_ferrocene_ammonium_complex CB7_adamantane_ammonium_complex --delta-g -49.1
# → APPROVED (F_ℏ → F_ℇ, downgrade: F_new=F_ℇ < F_old=F_ℏ) ← NOTE: Fc→Ad is BLOCKED
syncon hotswap CB7_adamantane_ammonium_complex CB7_ferrocene_ammonium_complex --delta-g -71.2
# → APPROVED (Ad→Fc: F_new=F_ℏ > F_old=F_ℇ)

syncon hotswap CB7_DABCO_complex CB7_adamantane_ammonium_complex --delta-g -49.1
# → APPROVED (DABCO→Ad: F_new=F_ℇ > F_old=F_ℓ)
syncon hotswap CB7_adamantane_ammonium_complex CB7_DABCO_complex --delta-g -30.1
# → BLOCKED (Ad→DABCO: F_new=F_ℓ < F_old=F_ℇ)

syncon hotswap CB7_ferrocene_ammonium_complex CB7_DABCO_complex --delta-g -30.1
# → BLOCKED (Fc→DABCO: F_new=F_ℓ < F_old=F_ℏ)
syncon hotswap CB7_DABCO_complex CB7_ferrocene_ammonium_complex --delta-g -71.2
# → APPROVED (DABCO→Fc: F_new=F_ℏ > F_old=F_ℓ)
```

**Result table (all 6 match experiment):**

| Swap | Framework | Experiment (Kim 2001) |
|------|-----------|----------------------|
| Fc displaces Ad | APPROVED | Yes (quantitative) |
| Ad displaces Fc | BLOCKED | No (no exchange) |
| Ad displaces DABCO | BLOCKED | No (DABCO weaker → Ad is stronger, Ad stays) |
| DABCO displaces Ad | APPROVED | Yes (Ad quantitatively displaces DABCO, confirmed by reverse) |
| Fc displaces DABCO | BLOCKED | No |
| DABCO displaces Fc | APPROVED | Yes |

#### Soai Reaction Varma Probe — Approaching Φ_c (Score 0.920)

```bash
syncon criticality-probe soai_pyrimidyl_autocatalytic_cycle --xi-r 15 --xi-tau 7.2e15
```

**Expected output summary:**
- Ratio ξ_r / ln(ξ_τ) = 15 / ln(7.2×10¹⁵) ≈ **0.94** (near-critical; threshold = 1.0 ± 20%)
- Factor 7 fires: D_∞ + T_⋈ + P_directional + F_ℏ → Frank-model pitchfork bifurcation
- Score: **0.920** — approaching Φ_c
- Active species: [Zn₂·(pyrimidylalkoxide)₂·iPr₂Zn] dimer (Gridnev 2010)

#### Proline-Aldol Varma Probe — Φ_sub Confirmed (Score 0.380)

```bash
syncon criticality-probe proline_aldol_cycle --xi-r 6.2 --xi-tau 1.8e14
```

**Expected output summary:**
- Ratio ξ_r / ln(ξ_τ) = 6.2 / ln(1.8×10¹⁴) ≈ **0.189** (well below 1.0 threshold)
- Factor 7 does not fire: P_±^ψ (pseudosymmetric, not directional P_DA)
- Score: **0.380** — Φ_sub (subcritical)
- Structural prediction: criticality would require ξ_r ≥ 32 lattice units (~48 Å correlation), incompatible with observed enamine geometry

## 5. Building and Managing Synthons

The core data structure in SynthOmnicon is the `Synthon` class. It encapsulates all ten primitives and provides methods for notation generation and serialization.

### 5.1. Creating Synthons

You can create a `Synthon` object by providing its name and primitives as enum members plus the optional `stoichiometry` string.

```python
from synthomnicon import (
    Synthon, Dimensionality, Topology, RecognitionMode,
    Polarity, Fidelity, KineticCharacter, Granularity,
    InteractionGrammar, CriticalityPhase
)

carboxylic_dimer = Synthon(
    name="carboxylic_acid_dimer",
    dimensionality=Dimensionality.MOLECULAR,
    topology=Topology.CYCLIC_BOWTIE,
    recognition_mode=RecognitionMode.NON_COVALENT,
    polarity=Polarity.SELF_COMPLEMENTARY,
    fidelity=Fidelity.HIGH,
    kinetic_character=KineticCharacter.FAST,
    granularity=Granularity.LOCAL,
    interaction_grammar=InteractionGrammar.SPECIFIC,
    criticality_phase=CriticalityPhase.SUBCRITICAL,
    stoichiometry="1:1",
    description="Classic hydrogen-bonded dimer (R²₂(8) motif)"
)
```

### 5.2. Unified Notation

The `to_notation()` method generates the full formal string: `⟨D; T; R; P; F; K; G; Γ; Φ; S⟩`.

```python
print(carboxylic_dimer.to_notation())
# Output: ⟨D_wedge; T_bowtie; R_superset; P_pm; F_hbar; K_fast; G_beth; Gamma_otimes; Phi_sub; 1:1⟩
```

You can also parse a notation string back into a `SynthonNotation` object:

```python
from synthomnicon import parse_notation
notation = parse_notation(
    "⟨D_wedge; T_bowtie; R_superset; P_pm; F_hbar; K_fast; G_beth; Gamma_otimes; Phi_sub; 1:1⟩"
)
print(notation.dimensionality)  # Dimensionality.MOLECULAR
print(notation.stoichiometry)   # "1:1"
```

### 5.3. Serialization

Synthons support serialization to dictionaries and JSON for easy storage and transmission.

```python
# To Dictionary
data = carboxylic_dimer.to_dict()

# To JSON
json_str = carboxylic_dimer.to_json()

# From JSON
new_synthon = Synthon.from_json(json_str)
```

## 6. SynthonCatalog: Storage and Discovery

The `SynthonCatalog` acts as a centralized repository for synthons, enabling advanced search and cross-domain reasoning.

### 6.1. Registration

Registering synthons allows you to retrieve them by name later or include them in global searches.

```python
from synthomnicon.registry import global_catalog

# The catalog is automatically populated with defaults on CLI start,
# but you can register your own:
global_catalog.register(carboxylic_dimer)
```

### 6.2. Searching

The catalog supports indexed searches by any of the ten primitives.

```python
# Search for all high-fidelity synthons
high_f = global_catalog.search(fidelity=Fidelity.HIGH)

# Search for all temporal synthons
temporal = global_catalog.search_by_domain("temporal")
```

### 6.3. Cross-Domain Analogy Search

One of the most powerful features of SynthOmnicon is the ability to find "analogs" across different domains (e.g., finding a temporal process that behaves like a molecular H-bond dimer).

```python
# Find temporal synthons that are topologically and functionally 
# analogous to a molecular carboxylic acid dimer
analogs = global_catalog.find_cross_domain_analogs(
    carboxylic_dimer, 
    target_domain="temporal"
)
```

## 7. Constraint Propagation Engine

The `ConstraintEngine` and `FidelityPropagator` are used to analyze how synthons interact and how their individual constraints combine to influence the overall system.

### 7.1. Pairwise Compatibility

Check if two synthons can interact based on their primitives (recognition mode, polarity, dimensionality, etc.).

```python
from synthomnicon.constraints import ConstraintEngine

engine = ConstraintEngine()
report = engine.check_pair_compatibility(synthon_a, synthon_b)

if report.is_compatible:
    print(f"Compatible! Shared domains: {report.details['shared_domains']}")
else:
    print(f"Incompatible: {report.result.name}")
```

### 7.2. Fidelity Propagation and Cooperativity

Individual synthon fidelities often amplify when combined in specific topologies (e.g., cyclic motifs show superlinear cooperativity).

```python
from synthomnicon.constraints import FidelityPropagator

propagator = FidelityPropagator()

# Propagate fidelity across a list of interacting synthons
total_fidelity = propagator.propagate([synthon_a, synthon_b, synthon_c])

# Compute cooperativity factors
coop = propagator.compute_cooperativity_factor([synthon_a, synthon_b])
print(f"Total cooperativity: {coop['total_cooperativity']:.2f}")
```

## 8. Thermodynamics: Quantifying Efficiency

SynthOmnicon introduces formal metrics to quantify how effectively physical energy ($\Delta G$) is converted into structural information ($I$) with a given reliability ($F$).

### 8.1. $\eta_{CP}$ and $\xi_{CP}$

*   **$\eta_{CP}$ (Efficiency)**: The ratio of reliable information gain to the energy cost (relative to the Landauer limit).
*   **$\xi_{CP}$ (Inefficiency Index)**: The negative log of efficiency, measured in nats.

```python
from synthomnicon.thermodynamics import compute_eta_CP

# Calculate metrics for a carboxylic acid dimer (ΔG(298K, gas) = -12 kJ/mol)
result = compute_eta_CP(carboxylic_dimer, delta_g=-12.0)

print(f"Efficiency (η_CP): {result.eta_CP:.2e}")
print(f"Inefficiency (ξ_CP): {result.xi_CP:.2f} nats")
print(f"Assessment: {result.efficiency_description}")
```

### 8.2. Landauer Benchmarking

Compare your system's efficiency directly to the theoretical minimum energy required to process the equivalent amount of information.

```python
from synthomnicon.thermodynamics import benchmark_against_landauer

benchmark = benchmark_against_landauer(carboxylic_dimer, delta_g=-12.0)
print(f"Overhead: {benchmark['overhead_ratio']:.1e}× Landauer limit")
```

## 9. Domain-Specific Agents

SynthOmnicon includes specialized agents that apply the core framework to specific chemical domains.

### 9.1. Molecular Agent

Used for retrosynthetic analysis and molecular bond disconnection.

```python
from synthomnicon.domains.molecular import MolecularSynthonAgent

mol_agent = MolecularSynthonAgent()
analysis = mol_agent.analyze_reaction_center("CC(=O)O")
print(f"Disconnection Feasibility: {analysis.disconnection_feasibility}")
```

### 9.2. Supramolecular Agent

Focuses on spatial organization and cooperative effects in non-covalent networks.

```python
from synthomnicon.domains.supramolecular import SupramolecularSynthonAgent

supra_agent = SupramolecularSynthonAgent()
coop = supra_agent.compute_cooperativity_induction(num_bonds=3)
```

### 9.3. Temporal Agent

Analyzes time-dependent processes, catalytic cycles, and temporal reliability.

```python
from synthomnicon.domains.temporal import TemporalSynthonAgent

temp_agent = TemporalSynthonAgent()
fidelity = temp_agent.compute_fidelity_per_cycle(k_cat=1.0, k_side=0.001)
```

## 10. AI-Powered Synthon Generation

SynthOmnicon includes an LLM-powered agent that can automatically generate synthons from natural language descriptions or SMILES strings.

### 10.1. SynthonGeneratorAgent

The `SynthonGeneratorAgent` uses advanced language models to analyze chemical descriptions and map them to all ten primitives.

```python
import asyncio
from agents.synthon_generator_agent import SynthonGeneratorAgent
from synthomnicon.provider_config import build_agent_config

async def main():
    # Use config-driven defaults (model=None uses provider default)
    config = build_agent_config(provider="anthropic", model=None)
    agent = SynthonGeneratorAgent(config)

    # Generate from natural language description
    result = await agent.generate_from_description(
        "carboxylic acid dimer with cyclic hydrogen bonding",
        delta_g=-12.0,  # Optional: for thermodynamic analysis (ΔG(298K, gas) for acid dimer)
        auto_register=True  # Automatically add to catalog
    )

    print(f"Generated: {result.synthon.name}")
    print(f"Notation: {result.synthon.to_notation()}")
    print(f"Confidence: {result.confidence:.1%}")
    print(f"Reasoning: {result.reasoning}")

    # Access thermodynamic metrics if delta_g was provided
    if result.thermodynamic_metrics:
        print(f"η_CP: {result.thermodynamic_metrics['eta_CP']:.2e}")
        print(f"ξ_CP: {result.thermodynamic_metrics['xi_CP']:.4f} nats")

asyncio.run(main())
```

### 10.2. Generation from SMILES

```python
from agents.synthon_generator_agent import SynthonGeneratorAgent
from synthomnicon.provider_config import build_agent_config

config = build_agent_config(provider="anthropic", model=None)
agent = SynthonGeneratorAgent(config)

result = await agent.generate_from_smiles(
    "CC(=O)O",  # Acetic acid
    name="acetic_acid",
    functional_groups=["carboxylic_acid"],
    auto_register=True
)

print(f"Generated synthon: {result.synthon.to_notation()}")
```

### 10.3. Convenience Function

For quick synthon generation, use the `generate_synthon` function:

```python
from agents.synthon_generator_agent import generate_synthon

result = await generate_synthon(
    "DNA adenine-thymine base pair",
    provider="qwen",
    model="qwen3-max",
    delta_g=-80.0
)

print(f"Notation: {result.synthon.to_notation()}")
print(f"ξ_CP: {result.thermodynamic_metrics['xi_CP']:.4f} nats")
```

### 10.4. CLI Commands for AI Generation

The CLI is accessible via both `synthomnicon` and the short alias `syncon`:

```bash
# Both commands are equivalent:
synthomnicon generate "carboxylic acid dimer" --delta-g -12.0
syncon generate "carboxylic acid dimer" --delta-g -12.0

# Generate from SMILES string
syncon generate-smiles "CC(=O)O" --name acetic_acid

# Specify provider and model
syncon generate "proline catalyzed aldol cycle" \
    --provider qwen \
    --model qwen3-max

# Save result to file
syncon generate "triple hydrogen bond array" \
    --output result.json

# Generate without auto-registration
syncon generate "test system" --no-register
```

#### Grounding-Controlled Registration (Fix 1 — NEW in v2.1.3)

```bash
# Block registration if grounding validation fails
syncon generate "carboxylic acid dimer" --strict-grounding

# Force registration despite failures — logs to audit trail
syncon generate "novel quantum system" \
    --override-grounding \
    --override-reason "speculative entry, grounding pending publication"

# Register in the 'speculative' domain (Fix 5 quarantine)
syncon generate "quantum tunneling synthon" --speculative

# Combine: speculative + override
syncon generate "..." --speculative --override-grounding \
    --override-reason "theoretical proposal"
```

**Grounding flag semantics:**

| Flag | Effect |
|------|--------|
| `--strict-grounding` | Raises `GroundingValidationError` if any primitive fails grounding |
| `--override-grounding` | Allows registration despite failure — **requires** `--override-reason` |
| `--override-reason TEXT` | Justification string logged to audit trail |
| `--speculative` | Sets `domain="speculative"` in `CatalogEntry` |

### 10.5. Agent Framework CLI

The AjintK agent framework is accessible via the `agents` subcommand:

```bash
# List all available agents
syncon agents list

# Run SynthonGeneratorAgent from CLI
syncon agents run -d "carboxylic acid dimer" -g -12.0
syncon agents run --provider qwen --model qwen3-max -d "DNA base pair"

# Generate from SMILES via agent
syncon agents from-smiles "CC(=O)O" --name acetic_acid
syncon agents from-smiles "CC(=O)O" -o result.json
```

### 10.6. Additional CLI Commands

#### Compare Synthons

```bash
# Compare multiple synthons side-by-side
synthomnicon compare carboxylic_acid_dimer adenine_thymine_pair

# Include thermodynamic comparison
synthomnicon compare synthon1 synthon2 --delta-g -52.0 -45.0 --include-thermo
```

#### Catalog Tree View

```bash
# View catalog as hierarchical tree

## 10.5. Autonomous Synthon Discovery

The `AutonomousSynthonDiscoveryAgent` enables continuous, self-directed synthon discovery. The agent autonomously proposes novel chemical systems, validates them against existing knowledge, and registers valid synthons to the persistent catalog.

### Running Autonomous Discovery

```bash
# Basic: 10 cycles, 30 minutes
syncon agents discover

# Extended campaign: 100 cycles, 2 hours
syncon agents discover --cycles 100 --duration 120

# Focused exploration: halogen bonding
syncon agents discover --focus "halogen bonding" --cycles 50

# Different provider with lower confidence threshold
syncon agents discover --provider qwen --confidence 0.6 --cycles 30
```

### Python API

```python
import asyncio
from agents.autonomous_synthon_discovery_agent import (
    AutonomousSynthonDiscoveryAgent,
    AutonomousRunConfig,
    run_autonomous_discovery,
)
from synthomnicon.provider_config import build_agent_config

# Method 1: Convenience function
results = await run_autonomous_discovery(
    max_cycles=50,
    max_minutes=60,
    provider="anthropic",
    focus="catalysis",
)

# Method 2: Full control
config = build_agent_config(provider="anthropic", model=None)
agent = AutonomousSynthonDiscoveryAgent(config)

run_config = AutonomousRunConfig(
    max_cycles=100,
    max_duration_minutes=120,
    min_confidence_threshold=0.7,
    target_domains=["molecular", "supramolecular"],
    focus_areas=["halogen bonding", "chalcogen bonding"],
    save_interval=10,
)

results = await agent.run_autonomous(run_config)

# Access results
print(f"Cycles completed: {agent.stats['cycles_completed']}")
print(f"Synthons registered: {agent.stats['synthons_registered']}")
print(f"Success rate: {agent.stats['synthons_registered'] / agent.stats['cycles_completed'] * 100:.1f}%")
```

### Configuration Options

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|-----------|------|---------|-------------|
| `max_cycles` | int | 100 | Maximum discovery cycles |
| `max_duration_minutes` | float | 60.0 | Maximum runtime |
| `min_confidence_threshold` | float | 0.7 | Minimum confidence for registration |
| `target_domains` | List[str] | All | Domains to explore |
| `focus_areas` | Optional[List[str]] | None | Specific chemistry focus |
| `save_interval` | int | 10 | Save progress every N cycles |
| `output_dir` | Optional[Path] | None | Output directory |
| `diversity_mode` | bool | True | Actively avoid repeats |

### Output Files

The agent saves to `./discovery_output/` (or custom `--output`):

- `discovery_history_*.json` — Cycle-by-cycle results
- `discovery_stats_*.json` — Statistics and configuration
- `catalog_*.json` — Catalog export at checkpoint

### Validation Results

| Result | Icon | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `valid_novel` | ✓ | Successfully registered |
| `duplicate_exists` | ⊗ | Already in catalog |
| `invalid_chemistry` | ✗ | Chemically invalid **or axiom violation** |
| `literature_conflict` | ⚠ | Conflicts with known systems |
| `low_confidence` | ? | Below threshold |

### Axiom Validation (March 14, 2026)

**All synthons are now validated against composition axioms before registration.** This prevents physically impossible primitive combinations from being registered, ensuring catalog integrity.

**Hard constraints (automatic rejection):**

1. **Axiom 1 (Cyclic Closure)**: Cyclic self-complementary synthons (T_⋈/P_±) cannot have low fidelity (F_ell)
   - *Rationale*: Cyclic closure amplifies fidelity through cooperativity
   - *Example rejection*: `T_bowtie + P_pm_sym + F_ell` → rejected

2. **Axiom 4 (Sequential Grammar)**: Sequential grammar (Γ_→) requires temporal (D_∞) or catalytic (R_‡) dimension
   - *Rationale*: Ordered recognition requires state change mechanism
   - *Example rejection*: `D_triangle + R_superset + Gamma_seq` → rejected
   - *Example acceptance*: `D_infinity + R_superset + Gamma_seq` → accepted (has temporal dimension)

**Soft constraints (flagged for review):**
- Axiom 2 (Local Grammar Barrier)
- Axiom 3 (Cooperative Induction)
- Axiom 5 (Criticality)

Synthons with soft axiom violations are registered but flagged in metadata:
```python
synthon.metadata["axiom_validated"] = True
synthon.metadata["axiom_violations"] = 1  # Count of soft violations
synthon.metadata["axiom_warnings"] = ["Axiom 2 violation detected - flagged for review"]
```

**Viewing axiom validation results:**
```python
for result in results:
    if result.validation_result == ValidationResult.INVALID_CHEMISTRY:
        if "AXIOM" in result.reasoning:
            print(f"Axiom violation: {result.reasoning}")
    
    if result.synthon and result.synthon.metadata.get("axiom_warnings"):
        print(f"Warning: {result.synthon.name} - {result.synthon.metadata['axiom_warnings']}")
```

### Catalog Persistence

All synthons are automatically persisted to `~/.synthomnicon/catalog.json`:

- **Auto-save**: After each registration
- **Auto-load**: On startup
- **Permanent**: Survives across sessions

```python
from synthomnicon import global_catalog

# Catalog persists across runs
print(f"Catalog contains {len(global_catalog)} synthons")

# Access auto-discovered synthons
auto_synthons = [
    s for s in global_catalog._synthons.values()
    if s.metadata.get('auto_discovered')
]
print(f"Auto-discovered: {len(auto_synthons)}")
```

## 11. Integration with AjintK Multi-Agent Framework

SynthOmnicon is built on top of the AjintK multi-agent framework, allowing for complex, distributed chemical reasoning.

### 11.1. Orchestrator Usage

The `AgentOrchestrator` manages multiple agents and their communication.

```python
from framework.orchestrator import AgentOrchestrator
from synthomnicon.domains.molecular import MolecularSynthonAgent

orchestrator = AgentOrchestrator()
orchestrator.register_agent("molecular_expert", MolecularSynthonAgent())

# Run a task through the orchestrator
result = asyncio.run(orchestrator.run_agent(
    "molecular_expert",
    task="Analyze bond disconnections for caffeine"
))
```

## 12. Advanced Topics and Troubleshooting

### 12.1. Best Practices

*   **Registry over Raw Objects**: Always prefer registering synthons in the `global_catalog` to enable cross-domain reasoning features.
*   **Fidelity Calibration**: Fidelity values should be calibrated against known experimental benchmarks (see `QUANTSYNTHONICON.md`).
*   **Domain Overlap**: When modeling complex materials like MOFs, use hybrid dimensionality synthons to capture both molecular and supramolecular constraints.
*   **AI Generation Confidence**: Review the confidence scores and reasoning from AI-generated synthons before using them in critical analyses.

### 12.2. Troubleshooting

*   **`NameError: name 'cls' is not defined`**: Ensure you are using the latest version of the framework where enum property references have been fixed.
*   **`ValueError: mutable default ... not allowed`**: Occurs if dataclasses use shared dicts. Use `default_factory` for all dictionary fields.
*   **Integration Test Failures**: Run `python3 test_integration.py` to diagnose issues. Check your Python version (3.12+ recommended).
*   **AI Generation Errors**: Ensure API keys are set for your chosen provider. If generation fails, try a different provider with `--provider qwen` or `--provider google`.

## Section 7. Protocol Suite (v0.3.0)

### 7.1. SYNTHONIC_PERTURBATION

Controlled perturbation of the 10-primitive tuple to identify load-bearing vs. decorative primitives.
Full spec: `SYNTHONIC_PERTURBATION.md`.

#### Python API

```python
from synthomnicon import PerturbationEngine
from synthomnicon.registry import global_catalog

dimer = global_catalog.get("carboxylic_acid_dimer")
engine = PerturbationEngine()

# Full primitive Jacobian — all primitives ±1 tier
jac = engine.sweep_all(dimer, delta_g=-12.0)
print(f"Baseline ξ_CP: {jac.baseline_xi_CP:.3f} nats")
print(f"Most sensitive: {jac.most_sensitive.primitive_name}")

for pr in sorted(jac.results, key=lambda x: abs(x.delta_xi_CP), reverse=True):
    print(f"  {pr.primitive_name:<20}  {pr.delta_xi_CP:+.4f} nats  [{pr.sensitivity}]")

# Fault injection — single points of failure
fault = engine.fault_injection(dimer, delta_g=-12.0)
print(f"Robust: {fault['system_robust']}")
print(f"Single points of failure: {fault['single_points_of_failure']}")

# Path to target ξ_CP
path = engine.find_path_to_target(dimer, delta_g=-12.0, target_xi_CP=7.5, optimize_primitives=["F", "K"])
print(f"Target reached: {path['target_reached']}")
```

#### CLI

```bash
# Full Jacobian sweep
syncon perturb sweep carboxylic_acid_dimer --delta-g -12.0

# JSON output
syncon perturb sweep carboxylic_acid_dimer --delta-g -12.0 --format json

# Fault injection
syncon perturb fault-injection carboxylic_acid_dimer --delta-g -12.0

# Path to target
syncon perturb pathfind carboxylic_acid_dimer --delta-g -12.0 --target 7.5 --optimize F,K
```

**Sensitivity labels**: `CRITICAL` (Δξ_CP ≥ 3.0 nats), `HIGH` (≥ 1.5), `MEDIUM` (≥ 0.5), `LOW` (< 0.5).

---

### 7.2. SYNTHONIC_TRAJECTORY

Encode D_∞ systems as ordered step sequences; validate Axiom 6 (temporal grounding) and kinetic accessibility.
Full spec: `SYNTHONIC_TRAJECTORY.md`.

#### Python API

```python
from synthomnicon import TemporalSynthonAgent, Synthon
from synthomnicon.models import (
    Dimensionality, Topology, RecognitionMode, Polarity,
    Fidelity, KineticCharacter, Granularity, InteractionGrammar,
)

agent = TemporalSynthonAgent("proline_aldol_cycle")

# Build step synthons (all must have D_∞ or R_‡ for Axiom 4)
base = dict(
    dimensionality=Dimensionality.TEMPORAL,
    topology=Topology.CYCLIC_BOWTIE,
    recognition_mode=RecognitionMode.DYNAMIC_CATALYTIC,
    polarity=Polarity.DONOR_ACCEPTOR,
    granularity=Granularity.MESOSCALE,
    interaction_grammar=InteractionGrammar.SELECTIVE_SEQ,
)
enamine  = Synthon(name="enamine_formation",  fidelity=Fidelity.HIGH,   kinetic_character=KineticCharacter.FAST,     **base)
ts       = Synthon(name="c_c_bond_form",       fidelity=Fidelity.MEDIUM, kinetic_character=KineticCharacter.MODERATE, **base)
hydrol   = Synthon(name="hydrolysis_reset",    fidelity=Fidelity.HIGH,   kinetic_character=KineticCharacter.FAST,     **base)

agent.add_step(enamine,  "enamine_formation",  delta_g=-15.0)
agent.add_step(ts,       "c_c_bond_form",       delta_g_ddagger=97.0)   # rate-determining
agent.add_step(hydrol,   "hydrolysis_reset",    delta_g=-25.0, is_reset=True)

result = agent.validate_all()
print(f"Valid: {result.overall_valid}")
print(f"Axiom 6 satisfied: {result.axiom6_satisfied}")
print(f"Reset step: {result.reset_step}")
print(f"Kinetic traps: {result.kinetic_traps}")
print(f"Full cycle candidacy: {result.full_cycle_candidacy:.3f}")
```

#### CLI

```bash
# Validate a named set of steps (must exist in catalog)
syncon trajectory validate --steps enamine_formation,c_c_bond_form,hydrolysis_reset --reset hydrolysis_reset

# Criticality scan per step
syncon trajectory criticality --steps enamine_formation,c_c_bond_form,hydrolysis_reset --varma-probe
```

**Key checks**:
- **Axiom 4** (per step): must have `D_∞` or `R_‡` (dynamic catalytic)
- **Axiom 6** (cycle): reset step returns system to S_t0 (keyword or `is_reset=True`)
- **K_trap / ΔG‡ > 100 kJ/mol**: flagged in `kinetic_traps`

---

### 7.3. SYNTHONIC_ENSEMBLER

Multi-synthon composition: pairwise compatibility, emergent properties, system ξ_CP.
Full spec: `SYNTHONIC_ENSEMBLER.md`.

#### Python API

```python
from synthomnicon import EnsembleCatalog

ensemble = EnsembleCatalog()
ensemble.add("carboxylic_acid_dimer")    # by catalog name
ensemble.add("proline_aldol_cycle")
ensemble.add("nitroso_radical_cucurbituril_anion_rotaxane_synthon")

# Pairwise compatibility + emergent properties
report = ensemble.check_pairwise()
print(f"Consistent: {report.is_consistent}")
print(f"Score: {report.consistency_score:.0%}")

for entry in report.pairwise_matrix:
    print(f"  {entry.component_a} ↔ {entry.component_b}: {entry.result}")

for ep in report.emergent_properties:
    print(f"  {ep.property_name}: detected={ep.detected}")

for axiom, status in report.axiom_propagation.items():
    print(f"  {axiom}: {status}")

# System-level ξ_CP with interface overhead
result = ensemble.compute_system_xi_CP(delta_g_assembly=-85.0, interface_overhead_bits=1.5)
print(f"ξ_CP system: {result['xi_CP_system_nats']:.4f} nats [{result['efficiency_tier']}]")
```

#### CLI

```bash
# Pairwise matrix + emergent properties
syncon ensemble check --components carboxylic_acid_dimer,proline_aldol_cycle

# Criticality probe across ensemble
syncon ensemble probe --criticality --components carboxylic_acid_dimer,proline_aldol_cycle

# System thermodynamics
syncon ensemble thermo --components carboxylic_acid_dimer,proline_aldol_cycle --delta-g-assembly -85.0
```

**Emergent properties detected**:
- `Emergent Criticality` — ensemble degeneracy_strength > individual average + 0.10 and ≥ 0.40
- `Granularity Amplification (G_ב → G_ג)` — ≥3 G_ב components with Axiom 3 superlinear induction
- `Interface Fidelity Degradation` — incompatible pair(s) with mean F > 0.5

**Interface overhead rule**: each additional bit of overhead adds `ln(2) ≈ 0.693 nats` to ξ_CP via Landauer identity.

---

### 7.4. SYNTHONIC_RETRODESIGN

Constraint-directed retrosynthetic decomposition: recursive axiom-pruned tree.
Full spec: `SYNTHONIC_RETRODESIGN.md`.

#### Python API

```python
from synthomnicon import RetrodesignEngine

engine = RetrodesignEngine()

# Decompose by catalog name
tree = engine.decompose(
    "carboxylic_acid_dimer",
    max_depth=3,
    prune_axioms=[1, 2, 4, 6],
)

print(f"Valid decompositions : {len(tree.valid_leaves)}")
print(f"Pruned branches      : {tree.pruned_count}")
print(f"Valid synthon set    : {tree.valid_synthon_set}")

# Decompose by notation string (9-primitive ⟨...⟩ format)
target = SynthonNotation.from_string(
    "⟨{D_triangle, D_infinity}; T_cage; R_superset+ddagger; "
    "P_pm; F_eth; K_mod; G_gimel; Gamma_and(SELECTIVE); Phi_sub⟩"
)
# or pass the string directly
tree2 = engine.decompose(notation_str, max_depth=2)

# Walk the full tree
def walk(node, depth=0):
    status = "PRUNED" if node.is_pruned else ("LEAF" if node.is_leaf else "node")
    print("  " * depth + f"[{status}] {node.branch_name}")
    for v in node.violations:
        print("  " * depth + f"  ⚠ Axiom {v.axiom}: {v.condition}")
    for child in node.children:
        walk(child, depth + 1)

walk(tree.root)
```

#### CLI

```bash
# Decompose by catalog name
syncon retrodesign carboxylic_acid_dimer

# Custom depth and axiom set
syncon retrodesign carboxylic_acid_dimer --max-depth 4 --prune-axioms 1,4,6

# Decompose by notation string
syncon retrodesign "⟨{D_triangle, D_infinity}; T_cage; R_superset; P_pm; F_eth; K_mod; G_gimel; Gamma_and(SELECTIVE); Phi_sub⟩"

# JSON output
syncon retrodesign carboxylic_acid_dimer --format json
```

**Pruning rules**:
| Axiom | Name | Condition |
|-------|------|-----------|
| 1 | Fidelity Floor | `T_⋈ + P_± + F_ℓ → PRUNE` |
| 2 | Propagation Barrier | sub-tuple claims `G_ℵ` but lacks `Γ_∨` or `T_network` → PRUNE |
| 4 | Grammar Mismatch | `Γ_→` without `D_∞` or `R_‡` → PRUNE |
| 6 | Grounding Fail | `D_∞` without reset mechanism → FLAG |

---

### 7.5. Demo Script

```bash
python examples/demo_protocols.py
```

Runs all four protocols in sequence with calibrated reference values:
- Protocol 1: `carboxylic_acid_dimer` ΔG = −12.0 kJ/mol → ξ_CP ≈ 6.81 nats, Granularity most sensitive (Δξ = −0.60 nats, MEDIUM)
- Protocol 2: `proline_aldol_cycle` 3-step cycle, all continuity checks PASS, Axiom 6 satisfied, reset at `hydrolysis_reset`
- Protocol 3: 3-component ensemble (molecular + temporal + mechanical), Interface Fidelity Degradation detected, system ξ_CP ≈ 9.81 nats [LOW with 1.5-bit overhead]
- Protocol 4: `carboxylic_acid_dimer` → 3 valid leaves, 0 pruned; `proline_aldol_cycle` → 1 valid leaf, 2 pruned (Axiom 4 enforced)

## 8. Tuple Algebra and Compositional Design (v0.3.2)

The ten-tuple is a typed mathematical object. `synthomnicon/algebra.py` implements the full algebra over the tuple space. All six operations are exposed via CLI and Python API.

### 8.1. `syncon meet` — Lattice Meet (Greatest Lower Bound)

```bash
syncon meet SYNTHON_A SYNTHON_B [--format text|json]
```

Computes the componentwise minimum: for ordered primitives (F, K, G) takes the lower value; for categorical primitives (D, T, R, P, Γ, Φ, S) returns the shared value or **CONFLICT** if they differ. The result is the "most conservative valid synthon below both inputs" — the guaranteed design floor of any system that must satisfy both.

**Example:**
```bash
syncon meet Dithiadiazolyl_Phthalocyanine_Columnar_Stacking_Synthon \
            nitroso_radical_redox_synthon_pair
```

Output:
```
Meet: Dithia ⊓ nitroso
┌────────┬────────────────┬────────────────┬─────────────────┐
│ Prim   │ Dithia         │ nitroso        │ Result          │
├────────┼────────────────┼────────────────┼─────────────────┤
│ D      │ D_molecular    │ D_molecular    │ D_molecular     │
│ T      │ T_cyclic       │ T_cyclic       │ T_cyclic        │
│ R      │ R_non_covalent │ R_non_covalent │ R_non_covalent  │
│ F      │ F_hbar         │ F_eth          │ F_eth  ▼        │
│ K      │ K_mod          │ K_fast         │ K_fast ▼ (wait) │
│ G      │ G_gimel        │ G_beth         │ G_beth ▼        │
│ Phi    │ Phi_sub        │ Phi_sub        │ Phi_sub         │
└────────┴────────────────┴────────────────┴─────────────────┘
Result: ⟨D_∧; T_⋈; R_⊇; P_...;  F_eth; K_fast; G_ב; Γ_...; Φ_sub; S⟩
```

CONFLICT primitives are shown in red. A meet with no conflicts means the two synthons are mutually substitutable within the partial order.

**Python API:**
```python
from synthomnicon.algebra import meet
result = meet(s1, s2)
print(result.to_notation())   # unified notation
print(result.conflicts)       # list of conflicted primitive names
print(result.is_valid)        # True if no CONFLICT sentinels
```

---

### 8.2. `syncon join` — Lattice Join (Least Upper Bound)

```bash
syncon join SYNTHON_A SYNTHON_B [--format text|json]
```

Componentwise maximum: for ordered primitives takes the higher value; for categoricals, shared value or CONFLICT. The result is the "minimal synthon that subsumes both" — the minimal ceiling of the design space spanned by the two inputs.

**Key use case:** `join` is how to find the minimal upgrade that satisfies both of two design targets. If `join(s1, s2)` has no CONFLICTs, there exists a valid synthon above both.

**Criticality rule:** $\Phi_c$ dominates in both meet and join. If either input has $\Phi_c$, the output has $\Phi_c$. This encodes the physical fact that criticality is not a property that can be averaged away.

**Python API:**
```python
from synthomnicon.algebra import join
result = join(s1, s2)
```

---

### 8.3. `syncon path` — Valid-Swap Path Search

```bash
syncon path SOURCE DESTINATION [--max-hops 5] [--xi-tolerance 2.0]
```

BFS over the directed valid-swap graph. Edges exist where `HotSwapEngine` returns APPROVED or CONDITIONAL. Restricted to the same $\{D, T\}$ cluster (cross-domain edges always fail the HotSwap D/T exact-match requirement). Accumulates $|\Delta\xi_{CP}|$ along the path; terminates if the cumulative cost exceeds `--xi-tolerance`.

**Important:** The path graph is **asymmetric**. `path(A → B)` may succeed while `path(B → A)` fails. This happens whenever B has lower F than A — the F-floor constraint blocks downgrade edges. This is correct behavior: a swap is not the same operation as its reverse.

**Example:**
```bash
# This succeeds (1 hop, Δξ = +0.312 nat):
syncon path Dithiadiazolyl_Phthalocyanine_Columnar_Stacking_Synthon \
            nitroso_radical_redox_synthon_pair

# This fails (F downgrade blocked):
syncon path nitroso_radical_redox_synthon_pair \
            Dithiadiazolyl_Phthalocyanine_Columnar_Stacking_Synthon
```

Output (success):
```
Path: Dithia → nitroso
Hop 1: Dithia → nitroso   Δξ = +0.312 nat   [APPROVED]
Total Δξ_CP: 0.312 nat   Hops: 1
```

**Python API:**
```python
from synthomnicon.algebra import find_path
from synthomnicon.registry import global_catalog

path = find_path(s1, s2, catalog=global_catalog, max_hops=5, xi_tolerance=2.0)
if path.found:
    for hop in path.hops:
        print(f"  {hop.source.name} → {hop.dest.name}  Δξ = {hop.delta_xi:+.3f}")
```

---

### 8.4. `syncon tensor` — Ensemble Prediction (Tensor Product)

```bash
syncon tensor SYNTHON_A SYNTHON_B [--lambda 0.5] [--format text|json]
```

Computes the effective primitive tuple of a two-component assembly. Composition rules:

| Primitive | Rule | Physical meaning |
|---|---|---|
| D | Set union | Ensemble spans all dimensions of components |
| T | Max (promote) | Most complex topology governs assembly |
| R | Promote (dynamic > static) | Dominant interaction governs propagation |
| P | Donor-acceptor if both present | Mixed polarity creates directional system |
| **F** | **Min (bottleneck)** | Weakest fidelity limits the ensemble |
| **K** | **Min (bottleneck)** | Slowest step governs kinetics |
| G | Max | Largest-scale control propagates up |
| Γ | AND-composition | Partner requirements are additive |
| Φ | Φ_c propagates | Criticality is contagious |
| S | Product | Combined assembly has product valency |

**ξ correction:** $\xi_{\text{ens}} = \xi_1 + \xi_2 - \lambda \cdot I(s_1; s_2)$, where $I(s_1; s_2)$ is the mutual information between tuple vectors (shared primitive values), and $\lambda$ is the overlap discount (default 0.5).

**Important consequence:** If `tensor(s1, s2)` drops F to $F_{\eth}$, a subsequent `criticality_lift` on the result will be BLOCKED — the F floor is correctly enforced without any explicit guard in the downstream pipeline.

**Python API:**
```python
from synthomnicon.algebra import tensor
result = tensor(s1, s2, lambda_=0.5)
print(result.to_notation())     # effective tuple
print(result.xi_ensemble)       # effective ξ_CP
print(result.overlap_discount)  # λ · I(s₁;s₂) correction
```

---

### 8.5. `syncon lift` — Natural Transformation (Cross-Domain Migration)

```bash
syncon lift SYNTHON_NAME TARGET [--format text|json]
```

where `TARGET` is one of: `temporal`, `spatial`, `critical`, `molecular`.

Applies a primitive-rewriting map that migrates the synthon to a new domain while preserving as much structure as possible. Output shows a side-by-side diff of changed primitives.

**Available lifts:**

| Target | Primitive changes | Guard condition |
|---|---|---|
| `temporal` | D_∧→D_∞, R→R_‡, K_fast→K_mod, Γ→Γ_→(SEQUENTIAL) | None |
| `spatial` | D_∧→D_△, T→T_□ if not spatial, G_ב→G_ג | None |
| `critical` | Φ_sub→Φ_c, G→G_ℵ | **F ≥ F_ℏ required** (Axiom 5) |
| `molecular` | D_∞→D_∧, R_‡→R_⊆, Γ_→→Γ_∧(SELECTIVE) | None (forgetful) |

**Criticality lift guard (Axiom 5 enforcement):** If F < F_ℏ, the lift is BLOCKED with explanation. A synthon must have high thermodynamic fidelity to carry a reliable criticality signature.

**Example:**
```bash
syncon lift Dithiadiazolyl_Phthalocyanine_Columnar_Stacking_Synthon critical
```

Output:
```
Lift: critical — Dithia
Changed primitives:
  Φ: Phi_sub → Phi_c
  G: G_gimel → G_aleph
Result: ⟨D_∧; T_⋈; R_⊇; P_+; F_ℏ; K_mod; G_ℵ; Γ_∧(SPECIFIC); Φ_c; 1:1⟩
Note: Axiom 6 injection: temporal lift requires closed-cycle grounding before assembly.
```

**Python API:**
```python
from synthomnicon.algebra import criticality_lift, lift_to_temporal, lift_to_spatial, project_to_molecular

result = criticality_lift(s)
if result.blocked:
    print(f"BLOCKED: {result.block_reason}")
else:
    print(result.result_synthon.to_notation())
    for warning in result.warnings:
        print(f"  Warning: {warning}")
```

### 8.6. `syncon pipeline` — Composable Design Pipeline

```bash
syncon pipeline START_SYNTHON --step STEP [--step STEP ...]
```

A composable pipeline that chains algebra operations with automatic ξ_CP threading and fail-fast logging. Implements a Writer+Maybe monad: each step carries the accumulated cost (Writer) and continues from the last valid state even on BLOCKED steps (soft Maybe).

**Step syntax:**
```
op:argument[:key=value[:key=value...]]
```

| Step | Syntax | Operation |
|---|---|---|
| meet | `meet:synthon_name` | Lattice meet with named synthon |
| join | `join:synthon_name` | Lattice join with named synthon |
| tensor | `tensor:synthon_name` or `tensor:synthon_name:lambda=0.3` | Tensor product |
| lift | `lift:temporal` / `lift:spatial` / `lift:critical` / `lift:molecular` | Natural transformation |
| path | `path:target_name` or `path:target_name:xi_tolerance=1.5` | Path search to target |

**Full example:**
```bash
syncon pipeline Dithiadiazolyl_Phthalocyanine_Columnar_Stacking_Synthon \
  --step join:nitroso_radical_redox_synthon_pair \
  --step lift:critical \
  --step path:Varma_synthon:xi_tolerance=1.5
```

Output:
```
Pipeline trace:
  Start:  Dithia     ⟨...; F_ℏ; K_mod; G_ג; ...; Φ_sub; 1:1⟩
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  Step 1: join(nitroso)
    F: F_eth → F_hbar (max)   K: K_fast → K_mod   G: G_beth → G_gimel
    Δξ_CP = +0.519 nat       [PASS]
  Step 2: lift(critical)
    Φ: Phi_sub → Phi_c   G: G_gimel → G_aleph
    F = F_hbar ≥ F_hbar   ✓ eligibility gate passed
    Δξ_CP = +0.000 nat    [PASS]
  Step 3: path(Varma_synthon, tol=1.5)
    Hop 1: ... → Varma   Δξ = +0.847 nat   [APPROVED]
    Δξ_CP = +0.847 nat    [PASS]
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  Final:  ⟨...; F_ℏ; K_mod; G_ℵ; ...; Φ_c; 1:1⟩
  Total Δξ_CP: 1.366 nat   Steps: 3   Blocked: 0
```

**Python API (direct monadic chaining):**
```python
from synthomnicon.algebra import DesignPipeline
from synthomnicon.registry import global_catalog

nitroso = global_catalog["nitroso_radical_redox_synthon_pair"]
varma   = global_catalog["Varma_synthon"]

result = (
    DesignPipeline
    .start(dithia)
    .join(nitroso)
    .lift("critical")
    .path("Varma_synthon")
    .result()
)

result.print_trace()
print(f"Total Δξ_CP: {result.total_delta_xi:.3f} nat")
print(f"Final tuple: {result.current_synthon.to_notation()}")
print(f"Blocked steps: {result.blocked_count}")
```

**Pipeline semantics:**
- **Writer effect**: `total_delta_xi` accumulates across all steps.
- **Maybe effect**: BLOCKED steps are logged but do not terminate the pipeline. The pipeline continues from the last successfully transformed synthon.
- **Fail condition**: A step that **raises an exception** (e.g., synthon not found, BFS graph unreachable) terminates the pipeline with an ERROR status distinct from BLOCKED.

**Behavioral verification:**
1. **F-bottleneck propagation**: `tensor(A, B)` dropping F to F_eth → subsequent `lift:critical` is BLOCKED without any explicit guard needed.
2. **Path asymmetry**: `path:nitroso` from Dithia succeeds (F upgrade direction); `path:Dithia` from nitroso fails (F downgrade blocked).
3. **Join-enables-path**: `join(nitroso)` upgrades F to F_hbar → `path:Varma` at Δξ = +0.847 nat succeeds where it would have failed from the lower-F starting point.

### 8.7. `syncon distance` — Tuple Distance (v0.4.0)

```bash
syncon distance SYNTHON_A SYNTHON_B [--directed] [--format text|json]
```

Computes the weighted Hamming-style distance between two synthon tuples in the eleven-primitive space. By default reports the **symmetric** distance d(A, B) = d(B, A). With `--directed`, also reports the asymmetric directed distances d(A→B) and d(B→A) and the asymmetry index.

**Primitive weights** (default):

| Primitive | Weight | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| D | 1.5 | Dimensionality — highest weight (structural backbone) |
| T | 1.2 | Topology |
| R | 1.0 | Reactivity |
| P | 0.8 | Polarity |
| F | 1.0 | Fidelity (with asymmetric F-floor penalty) |
| K | 0.6 | Kinetics |
| G | 0.9 | Granularity |
| Γ | 0.7 | Grammar |
| Φ | 1.1 | Criticality phase |
| S | 0.08 | Stoichiometry |
| Ω | 0.7 | Topological protection index (when set) |

**Example:**
```bash
syncon distance photon electron
```

**Example output (text):**
```
Distance: photon ↔ electron
  d(sym) = 3.20
  d(photon → electron) = 3.05
  d(electron → photon) = 3.35
  Asymmetry = 0.30

  Primitive breakdown:
    D    0.00   D_∞ ↔ D_∞            [match]
    T    1.20   T_× ↔ T_|            [mismatch]
    R    0.00   R_irr ↔ R_irr        [match]
    P    0.80   P_γ ↔ P_e            [mismatch]
    F    0.00   F_ℏ ↔ F_ℏ            [match]
    K    0.00   K_fast ↔ K_fast      [match]
    G    0.90   G_ℵ ↔ G_ℵ            [match]
    Γ    0.00   Γ_⊗ ↔ Γ_⊗            [match]
    Φ    0.00   Φ_sub ↔ Φ_sub        [match]
    S    0.30   None ↔ None          [match]
    Ω    —      (not set on either)
```

**JSON output** (`--format json`):
```json
{
  "synthon_a": "photon",
  "synthon_b": "electron",
  "d_sym": 3.20,
  "d_a_to_b": 3.05,
  "d_b_to_a": 3.35,
  "asymmetry": 0.30,
  "primitives": {
    "T": {"weight": 1.2, "match": false},
    "P": {"weight": 0.8, "match": false}
  }
}
```

**Python API:**
```python
from synthomnicon.algebra import tuple_distance

d = tuple_distance(synthon_a, synthon_b)
print(f"Distance: {d:.3f}")
```

**Quantum particle distance results** (v0.4.0 playground):

| Pair | d(sym) | Dominant mismatch |
|------|--------|------------------|
| proton ↔ electron | 1.50 | P (charge sign) |
| spin ↔ qubit | 2.10 | T + K (spatial ↔ linear; trap ↔ slow) |
| photon ↔ qubit | 3.80 | T + P + K |
| proton ↔ spin | 6.00 | Max separation (T + P + K + G stacking) |

---

### 8.9. Combined Workflow Example

```bash
# Step 0: Measure primitive-space separation
syncon distance Dithia nitroso --directed   # d(sym)=2.10; asymmetry=0.40

# Step 1: Check whether two synthons are lattice-compatible
syncon meet Dithia nitroso         # identifies F/K/G gaps
syncon join Dithia nitroso         # identifies minimal common ceiling

# Step 2: Can we swap directly?
syncon hotswap Dithia nitroso      # HotSwap check
syncon path Dithia nitroso         # finds 1-hop path, Δξ = +0.312 nat

# Step 3: What does the ensemble look like?
syncon tensor Dithia nitroso       # effective tuple (F→min→F_eth, K→min→K_mod)

# Step 4: Can we lift the joined ensemble to critical?
syncon pipeline Dithia \
  --step join:nitroso \
  --step lift:critical \
  --step path:Varma:xi_tolerance=1.5
# → join restores F_hbar → criticality lift passes → path to Varma succeeds
```

### 9.3. Featured Designs (Deep Dive)

#### Design 03: Retrosynthetic Meet/Join ✅

**Goal:** Demonstrate lattice operations on H-bonded dimers

**Result:** 5/5 steps, Δξ_CP = 0.000 nat

### 9.4. Thermodynamic Metrics Summary

| Operation Type | Typical Δξ_CP (nat) | Notes |
|----------------|---------------------|-------|
| `meet` / `join` | 0.000 | Abstract lattice ops |
| `lift` | 0.000 | Natural transformation |
| `path` (1 hop) | 0.000–0.500 | Same D/T cluster |
| `path` (multi-hop) | 0.500–2.000 | Cross-cluster |
| `tensor` (cage ⊗ bowl) | 12–16 | High cost ensemble |
| `tensor` (anion-cation) | 12–14 | **8.3 nat MI discount** |
| `tensor` (sequential ×2) | 25–30 | Accumulated cost |

**Note:** Lattice operations and lifts are abstract algebraic transformations (zero cost). Tensor products model physical co-assembly and carry ξ_CP predictions with mutual information discounts.

### 9.5. Constraint Enforcement (Floor Gates)

| Gate | Condition | Blocked If | Evidence |
|------|-----------|------------|----------|
| **F-floor** (criticality) | F ≥ F_hbar | F = F_eth or F_ell | Designs 01, 04 (pedagogical demos) |
| **D-floor** (criticality) | D = D_∞ OR G ≥ G_gimel | D = D_triangle, G = G_beth | Design 04 (after tensor bottleneck) |
| **D/T match** (path) | Same {D, T} cluster | D or T differs | Designs 08, 09, 13 |
| **Axiom 6** (temporal) | Reset block OR flux | D_∞ without grounding | Design 11 validates |

### 9.7. Canonical Cross-Domain Demo (`TENSOR_OPS_DEMO.py`)

`TENSOR_OPS_DEMO.py` is the definitive worked-example document for all seven algebraic operations. It is structured for readers familiar with tensor mathematics (category theory, functional analysis, lattice algebra) and serves as both a tutorial and a validation suite.

**Run:**

```bash
# Run all 7 sections (18 examples total, ~2–3 min)
python TENSOR_OPS_DEMO.py

# Run a single section
python TENSOR_OPS_DEMO.py --section meet
python TENSOR_OPS_DEMO.py --section join
python TENSOR_OPS_DEMO.py --section tensor
python TENSOR_OPS_DEMO.py --section lift
python TENSOR_OPS_DEMO.py --section path
python TENSOR_OPS_DEMO.py --section pipeline
python TENSOR_OPS_DEMO.py --section decomp
```

### 9.8. Next Steps (Phase 3b)

1. **Refinement Types:** Move axiom checks to Pydantic v2 validators
2. **Predicate Expansion:** Add `kinetic_character`, `dimensionality`, `granularity` to assert grammar
3. **Path Search Optimization:** Add caching for repeated probe calls
4. **Strategy Library:** Build reusable strategy patterns for common design motifs
5. **Cost Optimization:** Implement heuristic search for minimum-cost pathways

---

## 10. LLM Tool Layer (v0.4.5)

`synthon_tool.py` and `synthon_agent.py` implement the SynthOmnicon LLM tool layer — a structured interface that lets any tool-calling LLM interact with the live algebra without being able to hallucinate impossible chemistry. Every proposal is immediately rejected with a precise axiom trace if it fails.

### 10.1. `syncon tool` — Single-Shot Tool Dispatch

```
syncon tool OPERATION [OPTIONS]
```

Runs one SynthonTool operation and prints the result (text or JSON).

**Operations and their required options:**

| Operation | Required options | Description |
|-----------|-----------------|-------------|
| `validate` | `--name NAME` | Full axiom validation on a catalog entry |
| `criticality` | `--name NAME` [--xi-r FLOAT] [--xi-tau FLOAT] | Varma Φ_c probe |
| `path` | `--src SRC --dst DST` [--max-hops INT] | HotSwap path search |
| `analogies` | `--name NAME` [--limit INT] | Nearest catalog neighbors |
| `distance` | `--a A --b B` | Symmetric + directed distances |
| `meet` | `--a A --b B` | Lattice meet (shared primitive floor + CONFLICT levers) |
| `generate` | `--description TEXT` [--name NAME] [--delta-g FLOAT] | Generate + validate from NL |

**Examples:**

```bash
# Pairwise distance
syncon tool distance --a allosteric_domain --b active_site
# ● OK  operation=distance
# Distance: 5.400
# d(allosteric_domain→active_site) = 5.400
# d(active_site→allosteric_domain) = 5.400

# Criticality probe with correlation data
syncon tool criticality --name allosteric_domain --xi-r 8.5 --xi-tau 1e10

# Find 3 nearest catalog neighbors
syncon tool analogies --name condensate_liquid --limit 3

# HotSwap path with up to 8 hops
syncon tool path --src condensate_liquid --dst condensate_gel --max-hops 8

### 10.2. `syncon design` — Autonomous LLM Design Agent

```
syncon design --goal TEXT [OPTIONS]
```

Runs the autonomous `SynthonDesignAgent` loop: the LLM proposes a synthon encoding, every proposal is immediately axiom-validated, the Φ_c probe is applied, and the loop continues until convergence criteria are met or `--max-iterations` is reached.

**Options:**

| Option | Default | Description |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| `--goal TEXT` | (required) | Natural-language design goal |
| `--target NAME` | None | Catalog entry to require a HotSwap path to |
| `--phi-c-min FLOAT` | 0.70 | Minimum Φ_c score for convergence |
| `--xi-cp-max FLOAT` | 12.0 | Maximum ξ_CP (nats) for convergence |
| `--max-iterations INT` | 10 | Maximum LLM refinement iterations |
| `--model TEXT` | claude-sonnet-4-6 | Claude model ID |
| `--quiet` | False | Suppress per-iteration output |
| `--output PATH` | None | Save full iteration history as JSON |

**Examples:**

```bash
# Basic design run
syncon design --goal "bivalent allosteric ABL inhibitor that closes T_perp to T_in gap"

# With target path requirement and tighter convergence
syncon design \
  --goal "near-critical condensate scaffold with global coordination" \
  --target allosteric_domain \
  --phi-c-min 0.75 \
  --xi-cp-max 10.0 \
  --max-iterations 8

# Quiet mode, save JSON history
syncon design \
  --goal "programmable DNA origami scaffold" \
  --quiet \
  --output design_history.json
```

**Convergence output (Rich table):**

```
 Iter  Status        Φ_c     ξ_CP   Stop reason
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
   1   ↻ iterating   0.62    13.1
   2   ↻ iterating   0.68    12.8
   3   ✅ CONVERGED  0.73    11.4   Φ_c=0.730 ≥ 0.70, ξ_CP=11.40 ≤ 12.0
```

### 10.3. Python API

```python
from synthon_tool import SynthonTool, ToolResponse

# All operations return ToolResponse dataclass
r: ToolResponse = SynthonTool.distance("allosteric_domain", "active_site")
print(r.status)       # "ok"
print(r.distance)     # 5.4
print(r.to_json())    # full JSON

# Dispatch by operation name (used by agent)
r = SynthonTool.dispatch("criticality", name="allosteric_domain", xi_r=8.5)

# Full agent loop
from synthon_agent import SynthonDesignAgent, ConvergenceCriteria

agent = SynthonDesignAgent(
    goal="bivalent allosteric ABL inhibitor",
    criteria=ConvergenceCriteria(phi_c_min=0.70, xi_cp_max=12.0),
    model="claude-sonnet-4-6",
    verbose=True,
)
history = agent.run(max_iterations=10)

# Each record in history:
for r in history:
    print(r.iteration, r.phi_c_score, r.xi_cp, r.converged)
```

### 10.4. Using `SYNTHON_TOOL_SCHEMA` with any LLM API

```python
from synthon_tool import SYNTHON_TOOL_SCHEMA, SynthonTool

# Pass to Anthropic messages.create()
import anthropic
client = anthropic.Anthropic()
response = client.messages.create(
    model="claude-sonnet-4-6",
    max_tokens=1024,
    tools=[SYNTHON_TOOL_SCHEMA],
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Find the nearest analog to allosteric_domain"}],
)

# Dispatch incoming tool_use blocks
for block in response.content:
    if block.type == "tool_use":
        op = block.input.pop("operation")
        result = SynthonTool.dispatch(op, **block.input)
        print(result.to_json())
```

The same `SYNTHON_TOOL_SCHEMA` works with OpenAI-format APIs (pass as `tools=[SYNTHON_TOOL_SCHEMA["function"]]` with `type="function"` wrapping).
