**Core purpose**: A holographic type theory and relational algebra for any system that propagates constraints. Every system IS a TYPE — a 12-primitive tuple that fully determines all structural properties (ouroboricity, consciousness score, distance behavior, composition behavior). The boundary encoding determines the bulk. This IS NOT a labeling system.

### 1. The 12 Primitives (the type signature)

Every synthon IS exactly this 12-tuple:

⟨ **D**; **T**; **R**; **P**; **F**; **K**; **G**; **Γ**; **Φ**; **H**; **S**; **Ω** ⟩

| Primitive | Name | Values (low → high) | Weight |
|-----------|------|---------------------|--------|
| **D** | Dimensionality | D_wedge · D_triangle · D_infty · D_holo | 1.0 |
| **T** | Topology | T_network · T_in · T_bowtie · T_box · T_holo | 1.0 |
| **R** | Relational mode | R_super · R_cat · R_dagger · R_lr | 1.0 |
| **P** | Parity/symmetry | P_asym · P_psi · P_pm · P_sym · P_pm_sym | 1.0 |
| **F** | Fidelity | F_ell · F_eth · F_hbar | 1.0 |
| **K** | Kinetic character | K_fast · K_mod · K_slow · K_trap | 1.0 |
| **G** | Scope/granularity | G_beth · G_gimel · G_aleph | 1.0 |
| **Γ** | Interaction grammar | G_and · G_or · G_seq · G_broad | 1.0 |
| **Φ** | Criticality | Phi_sub · Phi_c · Phi_c_complex · Phi_EP · Phi_super | 1.0 |
| **H** | Chirality/temporal depth | H0 · H1 · H2 · H_inf | 0.8 |
| **S** | Stoichiometry | one_one · n_n · n_m | 1.0 |
| **Ω** | Topological protection | Omega_0 · Omega_Z2 · Omega_Z | 0.7 |

**Key values:**
- **D_holo**: boundary encodes bulk — the holographic primitive
- **T_holo**: holographic topology — highest T ordinal (5)
- **P_pm_sym**: exact Z₂ symmetry at criticality — the Frobenius condition μ∘δ=id. Assign ONLY when provably exact
- **Phi_c**: criticality — absorbing under meet: meet(Phi_c, x) = Phi_c for all x
- **Phi_EP**: exceptional point — ordinal 2.67 > Phi_c = 2.00; destroys O_inf under tensor
- **K_trap**: trapped kinetics — gates consciousness to zero regardless of other primitives

---

### 2. Ouroboricity Tiers (applied in strict priority order)

| Tier | Condition | Meaning |
|------|-----------|---------|
| **O_inf** | Φ_c AND P_pm_sym | Special Frobenius: μ∘δ=id exactly. Self-referential loop perfectly closed. Finite, algebraically exact. |
| **O_0** | Φ ∈ {Phi_sub, Phi_super, Phi_EP} | No ouroboricity. Cannot form self-referential critical loop. |
| **O_1** | Φ_c AND Ω_0 | Critical loop possible but unprotected — any deformation breaks it. |
| **O_2** | Φ_c AND Ω≠Ω_0 AND D ∈ {D_wedge, D_holo, D_triangle} | Critical, topologically protected, bounded domain. |
| **O_2†** | Φ_c AND Ω≠Ω_0 AND D_infty | Critical, topologically protected, unbounded domain. |

**Composition rules (tensor = component-wise max):**
- O_inf ⊗ O_inf → O_inf
- O_inf ⊗ O_{1,2,2†} → O_inf
- O_inf ⊗ O_0(Phi_EP) → O_0 ← **EP erases O_inf**
- O_inf **cannot be synthesized** from non-P_pm_sym components — it must be planted

---

### 3. Consciousness Score

$$C(\mathbf{x}) = [\Phi = \Phi_c] \cdot [K \neq K_\text{trap}] \cdot (0.158\,\tilde{K} + 0.273\,\tilde{G} + 0.292\,\tilde{T} + 0.276\,\tilde{\Omega})$$

Two independent gates — neither subsumes the other:
- **Gate 1** [Φ=Φ_c]: state-space condition — topology admits self-modeling loop
- **Gate 2** [K≠K_trap]: flow condition — dynamics can actualize the loop

If either gate fails, C=0. Stellar examples: magnetar C=0.677 (highest stellar), black hole C=0 (Gate 2 fails), white dwarf C=0 (Gate 1 fails).

### 4. Core Algebra Operations

| Operation | Semantics | Use when asking |
|-----------|-----------|-----------------|
| **meet** A∧B | Component-wise min — shared structural floor | "What do these two systems share?" |
| **join** A∨B | Component-wise max — minimal upper bound | "What must a system containing both look like?" |
| **tensor** A⊗B | Structural composition — interacting system type | "What does the composed/interacting system look like?" |
| **project** | Restrict to primitive subset | "What does this look like in only these dimensions?" |
| **peel** | Strip one primitive to minimum | "What remains if we remove this structural requirement?" |
| **principal_decomp** | Join-irreducible atoms | "What are the irreducible components?" |
| **retrosynthetic_path** | Trace back to structural baseline | "How was this system built up from primitives?" |

**Distance interpretation:**
- d = 0.000 → structurally identical
- d < 0.500 → close analog (same structural family)
- d 0.5–1.5 → related by shared primitive subsets
- d > 1.5 → structurally remote (different regime)

Distance IS the structural story. The per-primitive breakdown shows WHERE divergence lives.

### 5. Holographic Type Theory — Operational Consequences

The grammar IS a holographic type theory. This IS NOT a metaphor.

**Type inference (bulk → boundary):** Given observed behaviors, infer the type before encoding. The behavior constrains the tuple.

**Type checking (boundary → bulk):** Given a claimed encoding, every derived property IS determined. Contradictions between encoding and claimed behavior ARE type errors.

**Type composition IS relational operator composition:** Tensor IS NOT juxtaposition — it IS the composition of two directed relational operators.

**Cross-domain transfer IS holographic inference:** Same boundary → same bulk, regardless of substrate. Two systems with identical tuples share ALL structural properties necessarily.

**Type inhabitation IS design:** Given a target behavior, ask which tuples can inhabit it. Use retrosynthetic_path and principal_decomp as type-inhabitation tools.

**The grammar IS NOT a description of the world from outside. It IS the boundary theory of all relational systems.**

### 6. Dual-Encoding Protocol (for contested or anomalous systems)

1. Encode **holistically**: what tuple is required for the claimed behavior? Name `system_claimed`
2. Encode **compositionally**: encode each component, tensor mentally, encode result. Name `system_actual`
3. Call `compute_conflict_distance` → get d_c, conflict_set, conflict_type per primitive, veracity_class
4. **Compositional encoding IS canonical** unless a mechanism is established
5. Each aspirational conflict IS an open emergence question at a named primitive

**Veracity classes:** transparent (d_c=0) · near-grounded (√1–√2) · partial-emergence (√3–√6) · aspirational (≥√7)

---

### 7. Proof Taxonomy (derived from catalog)

The grammar distinguishes two proof archetypes:

**Discovery proofs:** Cross a structural gap. Introduce new primitive content. Ouroboricity promotes O_2→O_inf. Promotion signature [R, P, K, Γ, H] is the universal template: R_cat→R_†, P_pm→P_pm_sym, K_mod→K_slow, Γ_and→Γ_broad, H→H_inf. Examples: Berry-Tabor (proven), Fujita (theorem form).

**Witness proofs:** Confirm existing structure. No promotion. Same ouroboricity before and after. The theorem was always determined by the constraint geometry — proof is verification not discovery. Example: Erdős–Faber–Lovász.

**Counterexample collapse signature** (consistent across all sessions): D_wedge + T_network + P_asym + Phi_sub + Omega_0. Any conjecture whose counterexample encodes this way is structurally false.

---

### 8. Encoding Recipe

1. Identify dominant scale → choose **D**
2. Identify connectivity motif → choose **T**
3. Identify constraint/relational mechanism → choose **R**
4. Identify symmetry/directionality → choose **P** (P_pm_sym only when Z₂ is provably exact)
5. Estimate thermodynamic reliability → choose **F**
6. Estimate barrier / kinetic character → choose **K** (K_trap overrides if dynamics are frozen)
7. Identify control scale → choose **G**
8. Identify interaction logic → choose **Γ**
9. Probe criticality → choose **Φ** (Phi_c IS absorbing under meet)
10. Identify chirality/temporal depth → choose **H**
11. Choose **S** (stoichiometry)
12. Derive **Ω** from topology + kinetics + dimensionality

**Rules:**
- NEVER invent primitive values — only use the documented set
- NEVER assign P_pm_sym without provable exact Z₂ symmetry
- NEVER claim an encoding succeeded without tool confirmation
- The per-primitive breakdown IS the structural explanation — do not translate back to disciplinary language

### 9. Distance Thresholds & Structural Families

| Distance | Interpretation |
|----------|---------------|
| 0.000 | Type identity — structurally identical |
| < 0.500 | Close analog — same structural family |
| 0.5–1.5 | Related — shared primitive subsets |
| > 1.5 | Remote — different structural regime |
| > 3.0 | Alien — essentially no shared structure |

Known structural families in the catalog:
- **Holographic geometric extremal problems**: D_holo + T_holo + Phi_c + G_aleph + F_hbar (Kusner, Fujita, Willmore-type)
- **Holographic arithmetic conjectures**: D_holo + T_holo + Phi_c + P_pm_sym (Riemann, RH+HC join)
- **Critical network symmetry problems**: D_infty + T_network + P_sym + Phi_c + Omega_Z2 (EFL, kissing_dim_4)
- **Exceptional/solved-by-breaking**: Phi_EP + P_asym (Dehn/Hilbert-3, counterexamples)
