# Synthonic HotSwapping: Dynamic Component Exchange Protocol

## 1.0 System Definition
**Synthonic HotSwapping** is the operational procedure of replacing a registered synthon ($S_{old}$) within an active chemical system without collapsing the global constraint architecture ($\Psi$). The objective is to maintain system invariance ($\Psi_{initial} \approx \Psi_{final}$) or transition predictably to a target state ($\Psi_{target}$) while preserving the integrity of the ten-primitive tuple $\langle D; T; R; P; F; K; G; \Gamma; \Phi; S \rangle$.

This protocol leverages the SynthOmnicon v2.2 framework, utilizing axiom validation, thermodynamic efficiency metrics ($\xi_{CP}$), and criticality probing to ensure compatibility prior to exchange.

## 2.0 Pre-Swap Compatibility Criteria
Candidate synthons must pass a rigorous interface check via the `ConstraintEngine`. Compatibility is determined by primitive alignment within defined tolerances.

### 2.1 Primitive Matching Matrix
| Primitive | Requirement | Rationale |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Dimensionality ($D$)** | **Exact Match** | Swapping $D_\infty$ (temporal) into a $D_\wedge$ (molecular) slot collapses the operational coordinate set. |
| **Topology ($T$)** | **Exact Match** | A cyclic motif ($T_⋈$) cannot replace a linear chain ($T_≫$) without rewiring connectivity. |
| **Stoichiometry ($S$)** | **Exact Match** | A 1:1 dimer cannot replace a 2:1 host-guest complex without altering global mass balance (Pass 4 Audit). |
| **Recognition ($R$)** | **Compatible Class** | $R_⊇$ (non-covalent) may swap with $R_{⊆+‡}$ (dynamic covalent). Static $R_⊆$ is generally not hot-swappable. |
| **Polarity ($P$)** | **Complementary** | Must match the environment's polarity constraints (e.g., $P_±$ for homodimers). |
| **Fidelity ($F$)** | **$F_{new} \geq F_{old}$** | Swapping $F_ℏ$ (High) for $F_ℓ$ (Low) increases entropy production ($\xi_{CP}$), risking system destabilization. |
| **Kinetic Character ($K$)** | **Accessible Pathway** | Both synthons must share accessible kinetic pathways ($K_{fast}$ or $K_{mod}$). |
| **Criticality ($\Phi$)** | **Degeneracy-dependent** | Unconfirmed $\Phi_c$ (degeneracy\_strength < 0.70): treat as $\Phi_{\text{sub}}$, normal swap rules. Confirmed $\Phi_c$ (score ≥ 0.70, Varma probe run): swap permitted *with* Varma confirmation — not blanket prohibition. Axiom 5 predicts that at true criticality the primitive basis contracts, making local swaps *more* tolerant, not less. |

### 2.2 Fidelity & Kinetic Thresholds
*   **Fidelity Calibration:** $F$ is anchored to $\xi_{CP}$ tiers (HIGH ≤ 8.5 nats, MEDIUM 8.5–11.0 nats, LOW > 11.0 nats). The swap should not increase inefficiency beyond $\Delta \xi_{CP} < 1.0$ nat. A 1-nat drift is approximately equivalent to losing ~1 bit of recognition information or weakening one contact by ~1.7 kJ/mol at 298 K.
*   **Kinetic Accessibility:** If $K_{old}$ is $K_{fast}$ and $K_{new}$ is $K_{slow}$, the swap may create a kinetic bottleneck, effectively freezing the system state.
*   **K-Compatibility Score (pathway multiplicity):** Scalar $\Delta G^{\ddagger}$ tier is insufficient for $K_{\text{trap}}$ detection. After identifying a candidate, run a fast relaxed scan or short MD near the operative TS and count new low-energy pathways. If $S_{new}$ introduces **more than two new low-energy pathways** not present in $S_{old}$, apply an automatic $+0.5$ nat penalty to $\Delta\xi_{CP}$. This tightens the 1.0-nat tolerance for high-multiplicity swaps without modifying the primary threshold for well-behaved systems.

### 2.3 Network Topology Stoichiometry Tolerance
For $G_{\aleph}$ assemblies (crystal lattices, MOF networks, extended supramolecular frameworks), exact $S$ matching is relaxed via the `--allow-defect-fraction` flag:

```bash
syncon analogies target_synthon --stoichiometry-aware --allow-defect-fraction 0.25
```

This permits partial substitution up to 25% defect fraction without violating mass balance, because network topology ($T_{\square}$) absorbs per-node variance. The flag is **restricted to $G_{\aleph}$** — molecular-scale swaps ($G_{\beth}$) and mesoscale swaps ($G_{\gimel}$) retain exact $S$ matching.

## 3.0 The HotSwap Protocol (5-Step Workflow)

### Step 1: Target Identification
Identify the synthon to be replaced within the global catalog.
```python
from synthomnicon.registry import global_catalog
target = global_catalog.get("carboxylic_acid_dimer")
```

### Step 2: Candidate Selection (Analogy Search)
Find potential replacements using cross-domain analogy search. Focus on systems with similar constraint profiles.
```bash
# CLI: Find analogs with strict stoichiometry awareness
syncon analogies carboxylic_acid_dimer --stoichiometry-aware --limit 5
```
Prioritize candidates with $\Phi_{sub}$ (_subcritical_) status. Critical systems ($\Phi_c$) are highly sensitive to perturbation and may cascade to failure upon component exchange.

### Step 3: Axiomatic Validation
Run the candidate against the composition axioms to ensure it doesn't violate global constraints.
```python
from synthomnicon.constraints import AxiomValidator

validator = AxiomValidator()
report = validator.validate(candidate_synthon)
if not report.all_satisfied:
    raise ValueError(f"Swap blocked: {report.violations}")
```
*   **Critical Check:** Axiom 1 (Cyclic Closure). If swapping into a cyclic motif, ensure the new synthon maintains $F \geq F_ℇ$.
*   **Critical Check:** Axiom 7 (Cyclic Grounding). Ensure the new synthon has a named closing bond compatible with the existing scaffold.

### Step 4: Thermodynamic Feasibility Check
Calculate the efficiency gap. The swap should not increase inefficiency ($\xi_{CP}$) beyond a tolerable threshold.
```python
from synthomnicon.thermodynamics import compute_eta_CP

# Compare inefficiency indices
xi_old = compute_eta_CP(target, delta_g=-12.0).xi_CP   # ΔG(298K, gas) basis
xi_new = compute_eta_CP(candidate, delta_g=-12.0).xi_CP  # use ΔG, not ΔE

if xi_new > xi_old + 1.0:
    print("WARNING: Swap increases thermodynamic waste significantly.")
```

### Step 5: Execution & Verification
Experimental execution requires dynamic conditions (e.g., solvent exchange, thermal activation, or catalytic turnover) to enable the dissociation of $S_{old}$ and association of $S_{new}$ without global disassembly.

Post-swap, verify the system state:
1.  **Re-run Constraint Propagation:** Ensure global constraint strength remains within 90% of initial value.
2.  **Grounding Audit:** Verify the new synthon registers with `grounding_status=full` or `partial`.
```bash
syncon audit --status unverified --dry-run
```
3.  **Spectroscopic Confirmation:** The framework computes the target observable from $S_{new}$ geometry. Confirm the swap experimentally before declaring success:
    *   $R_{\supseteq}$ (H-bond) swap: verify H-bond stretch shift **> 30 cm⁻¹** in IR/Raman relative to $S_{old}$.
    *   $R_{\ddagger}$ (catalytic cycle) swap: verify turnover frequency within 2× of $S_{old}$ under identical conditions.
    *   $R_{\Leftrightarrow}$ (mechanical bond) swap: verify threading by NMR chemical shift of axle protons (crown ring current effect).
    *   ITC binding isotherm integration confirms stoichiometry $S_{new}$ is preserved.

    Incomplete exchange — residual $S_{old}$ fragments poisoning the $S_{new}$ assembly — is the most common failure mode in practice. The spectroscopic check catches this before any downstream analysis.

## 4.0 Risk Assessment & Failure Modes

| Failure Mode | Primitive Signature | Mitigation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Constraint Collapse** | $F_{new} \ll F_{old}$ | Hard block — enforce $F$ floor at query time (Axiom 1). |
| **Kinetic Trap** | $K_{new} = K_{\text{trap}}$; >2 new pathways near TS | K-compatibility check; +0.5 nat $\Delta\xi_{CP}$ penalty for high multiplicity. |
| **Axiom Violation** | $T_{\bowtie} + F_{\ell}$; $\Gamma_{\to}$ without $D_{\infty}$ | Registration blocked; detailed violation report. |
| **Grounding Drift** | `grounding_status` → `unverified` | Require full/override grounding before swap; `syncon audit`. |
| **Stoichiometry Mismatch** | $S_{new} \neq S_{old}$ (molecular scale) | Exact match mandatory for $G_{\beth}$/$G_{\gimel}$; `--allow-defect-fraction` for $G_{\aleph}$ only. |
| **Incomplete Exchange** | Residual $S_{old}$ fragments | Spectroscopic confirmation required before declaring success. |
| **Criticality Disruption** | Unconfirmed $\Phi_c$ candidacy, premature swap | Run Varma probe first if degeneracy\_strength > 0.70; confirmed $\Phi_c$ is swap-tolerant per Axiom 5. |

## 5.0 Case Studies (Framework Grounded)

### 5.1 Supramolecular Linker Exchange (MOF Defect Engineering)
*   **Context:** Swapping a linker in a Metal-Organic Framework ($D_{\bigtriangleup}$, $T_{\square}$, $G_{\aleph}$). Example: terephthalate → 2-aminoterephthalate in UiO-66.
*   **Requirement:** New linker must match $D$/$T$/$S$ exactly and preserve $F_{\hbar}$. $P$ must match the node's coordination polarity ($P_+$ accepting carboxylate $P_-$).
*   **Network tolerance:** Use `--allow-defect-fraction 0.25` — up to 25% substitution documented in UiO-66 defect engineering without topology collapse. $\Delta\xi_{CP}$ change < 0.5 nat expected.
*   **Framework Tools:** `syncon analogies --stoichiometry-aware --allow-defect-fraction 0.25`; `syncon criticality-probe` to confirm $\Phi_{\text{sub}}$ before swap.
*   **Feasibility:** Requires solvothermal conditions or solvent-assisted linker exchange (SALE); $K_{\text{mod}}$ for exchange step.

### 5.2 Temporal Cycle Catalyst Swap
*   **Context:** Replacing the catalyst in a Proline Aldol Cycle ($D_{\infty}$, $T_{\bowtie}$, $R_{\ddagger}$, $K_{\text{mod}}$, $S=1:1$). Example: (S)-proline → MacMillan imidazolidinone or thiourea organocatalyst.
*   **Hard requirements:** Same $K_{\text{mod}}$ and same hydrolytic reset mechanism (Axiom 6). Protocol blocks swaps to catalysts without a defined turnover reset — a common failure mode where the new catalyst has no hydrolysis cycle.
*   **K-compatibility:** Both iminium (MacMillan) and thiourea pathways can introduce additional low-energy conformational pathways. Run K-compatibility check; >2 new pathways → +0.5 nat $\Delta\xi_{CP}$ penalty applied automatically.
*   **Verification:** Monitor enamine/iminium intermediate by NMR or UV-Vis; confirm ee within 10% of baseline (74% for proline/DMSO benchmark).

### 5.3 Speculative System Integration (Boronate Verdazyl Triangle)
*   **Context:** Integrating a novel frustrated magnetic triangle into a supramolecular lattice.
*   **Constraint:** The system contains sulfur bridges and boronate esters not fully accounted for in standard grounding libraries.
*   **Protocol:**
    1.  Register with `--speculative` flag to quarantine in the `quantum` or `speculative` domain.
    2.  Use `--override-grounding` with `--override-reason` to bypass Axiom 7 checks if the closing bond mechanism is theoretical.
    3.  **Do not** hotswap speculative synthons into grounded molecular systems without empirical validation. Semantic contamination risk may corrupt catalog integrity and prediction accuracy.

## 6.0 Advanced: The "Quantum Quarantine" Swap
For speculative systems (quantum synthons, hypothetical topologies):
1.  Register the new synthon with `--speculative` flag.
2.  Isolate in `domain=quantum` or `domain=speculative`.
3.  Do not attempt to hotswap speculative synthons into grounded molecular systems. The semantic contamination risk (Fix 5 in SYNTHONICON_FIXES.MD) may corrupt catalog integrity and prediction accuracy.

## 7.0 Connection to Transformation #8 and Phase 3

**Transformation #8 as canonical Φ_c HotSwap test.** The DB24C8/dialkylammonium rotaxane dethreading scan (QUANTSYNTHONICON.md Section V) is the highest-priority experimental anchor for this protocol. The steric-cliff transition state at ~4–5 Å is the first candidate where degeneracy\_strength ≥ 0.70 (logarithmic class) may be achievable from a real scan. If confirmed:

- Axle stopper exchange in a living pseudorotaxane machine becomes the first empirically grounded $\Phi_c$ HotSwap.
- The plateau regime (~20–50 kJ/mol H-bond weakening) maps to a $K_{\text{mod}}$ swap window — kinetically accessible without full dethreading.
- The steric window width ($\sigma_{\text{steric}}$) directly refines $I_{\text{angle}}$ for $R_{\Leftrightarrow}$ systems.

**Phase 3 integration.** HotSwapping is Phase 3 in miniature: it converts the grammar from descriptive into operational. With the ten-primitive tuple as a typed action space, an LLM agent can call `syncon analogies → AxiomValidator.validate() → compute_eta_CP()` in a loop and remain axiom-compliant throughout. This gives AI-driven design a hard safety layer — not just "generate a plausible structure" but "generate a swap that provably satisfies all composition axioms and stays within 1.0 nat of the target efficiency."
