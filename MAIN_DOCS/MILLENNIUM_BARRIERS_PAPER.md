# SynthOmnicon: Millennium Barriers
## *A Formal Barrier Taxonomy for the Millennium Prize Problems in Lean 4*

**Version:** v0.2.0 · 2026-04-14
**Authors:** Lando⊗LLM
**Document role:** Self-contained research paper. Presents the machine-checked barrier taxonomy for all seven Clay Millennium Prize Problems, the `BarrierType` inductive, the `ym_is_unique_missing_foundation` theorem, the stacked/parallel sorry distinction, and the primitive bridge connecting sorry boundaries to the SynthOmnicon constraint grammar. Target venue: Journal of Formalized Reasoning / Journal of Automated Reasoning.

*The distinction that matters throughout: 'we have formalized' is not the same as 'we have solved.' Every `sorry` at the core of this library is honest. No Millennium Problem is proved here. The contribution is the meta-level structure  --  what kind of thing each sorry is, and why.*

## Three-Document Architecture

The SynthOmnicon Lean library occupies two tracks: `Primitives/` (the 12-primitive constraint grammar) and `Millennium/` (the barrier taxonomy library documented here). This paper reports on the `Millennium/` track and its bridge to `Primitives/`.

**Internal references** within this paper use §N.

**Library location:** `SynthOmnicon/Millennium/`  --  nine files, approximately 1,524 lines. Build target: `lake build Millennium`.

## I. Introduction (v0.1.0, 2026-03-26)

The Clay Mathematics Institute seven Millennium Prize Problems have resisted proof for decades  --  and in one case, the Riemann Hypothesis, for over a century and a half. Proof assistants have formalized large bodies of mathematics, but existing efforts overwhelmingly target *results that are known*: the Last Theorem of Fermat, the Four Color Theorem, the Kepler Conjecture. Far less attention has been paid to formalizing *why specific problems are hard*  --  the structural barriers that distinguish them from merely difficult but open problems.

This paper presents a formal barrier taxonomy for all seven Millennium Problems in Lean 4. We make no claim to have solved any of them. The contribution is meta-level: a machine-checked classification of the proof obligations, the structural relationships between them, and their connection to an underlying primitive constraint algebra.

### I.1 Why this matters

The distinction between barrier types has practical consequences for the formalization community.

**MathlibGap sorries are actionable.** A contributor with the right background can in principle discharge them by formalizing a known proof. The `euler_opn_form` sorry in OPN.lean (Euler 1747) and the `mazur_torsion` sorry in BSD.lean (Mazur 1977) are of this type.

**OpenProblem sorries define the research frontier.** They cannot be discharged without solving the underlying mathematics. Knowing which sorries are of this type  --  as opposed to merely MathlibGap  --  is useful for anyone building on the library.

**MissingFoundation sorries are qualitatively harder than OpenProblems.** An OpenProblem has a well-typed proposition whose truth value is unknown. A MissingFoundation sorry requires inhabiting a *type* that does not yet exist as a rigorous mathematical object  --  the question cannot even be fully stated until the foundation is built. Yang-Mills is the only Millennium Problem in this category. We prove this formally.

### I.2 The sorry depth distinction

We introduce a formal notion of *sorry depth* distinguishing *stacked* from *parallel* proof obligations.

**Stacked (Yang-Mills):** sorry $B$ depends on sorry $A$  --  the mass gap cannot be stated as a proposition until the quantum Yang-Mills theory is known to exist.

**Parallel (BSD):** three sorries are logically independent  --  Mordell-Weil (proved 1922, MathlibGap), the Mazur torsion theorem (proved 1977, MathlibGap), and the BSD rank formula itself (OpenProblem)  --  each dischargeable independently.

Both Yang-Mills and BSD have `sorryDepth = 2`. The structural difference is encoded in the barrier type.

### I.3 Contributions

**C1  --  BarrierType taxonomy:** A typed inductive with three constructors, formally distinct (by `decide`), and computably assigned to all seven Millennium Problems.

**C2  --  ym_is_unique_missing_foundation:** A theorem, proved by `decide`, that Yang-Mills is the only Millennium Problem whose barrier is MissingFoundation.

**C3  --  Stacked vs parallel sorry distinction:** Formalized in `sorryDepth` and `ym_has_stacked_not_parallel_sorries`.

**C4  --  NS critical Sobolev exponent:** Machine-verified by `norm_num` that $0 < \frac{1}{2} < 1$  --  the formal statement of why NS regularity is hard.

**C5  --  OPN in real Mathlib:** the Touchard congruence type-checks using actual `Nat.Perfect` and `ArithmeticFunction.sigma`.

**C6  --  BSD in real Mathlib:** `BSDRankConjecture` stated using actual `WeierstrassCurve ℚ` and `IsElliptic`; three parallel sorries formally justified.

**C7  --  PrimitiveBridge.lean:** Formal connection between sorry boundaries and primitive field transitions in the SynthOmnicon grammar; `BarrierPrimitiveCertificate` structure; `primitive_bridge_master` theorem.

**C8  --  RH–Lee-Yang structural correspondence (v0.1.2):** Machine-checked theorem that the Riemann $\zeta$ zeros and Lee-Yang partition-function zeros share the same Criticality assignment `Phi_c_complex`. Structural distance 7 (machine-checked; corrected from v0.1.1 which stated 5) identifies the polarity primitive $P$ ($P_\text{sym}$ vs $P_{\pm}^{\text{sym}}$) as the essential structural gap; remaining 6 mismatches (T, F, K, gran, stoi, chir) are background differences. Enabled by the $\Phi$ primitive expansion: `Phi_c` → `Phi_c` / `Phi_c_complex` / `Phi_EP`.

**C11  --  Crystal arithmetic machine-verified (v0.2.0):** Two `decide` proofs in `Core.lean`: `crystal_total : 27 * 1024 * 625 = 17280000` (the full cardinality $3^3 \times 4^5 \times 5^4$ of the Periodic Crystal of Algebras, §64) and `ouroboros_successor_cycle : 3 → 4 → 5 → 3$ (the $\mathcal{F}_3/\mathcal{F}_4/\mathcal{F}_5$ exponent cycle, §68). These are the first machine-checked arithmetic facts about the Crystal; prior documentation was informal.

**C12  --  Frobenius non-synthesizability machine-verified (v0.2.0):** `frobenius_not_synthesizable` and `tensor_O_inf_O2_destroys_frobenius` are now `decide`-verified in `Core.lean` and `Synthon.lean`. The theorem that $P_{\pm}^{\text{sym}}$ cannot be obtained by tensor composition from partners with $P < P_{\pm}^{\text{sym}}$ (§23/§62) is no longer a documented claim but a kernel-checked proof. Consequences: `ouroboricityTier` is a decidable function on $(Φ, P, Ω, D)$; `o_inf_iff_P_pm_sym_at_phi_c` is a machine-verified biconditional.

---

## II. Background (v0.1.0, 2026-03-26)

### II.1 Lean 4 and Mathlib

All code targets **Lean 4.28.0** with **Mathlib v4.28.0**. We use `import Mathlib.Tactic` throughout plus specific imports per file:

| File | Key Mathlib imports |
| :--- | :--- |
| **OPN.lean** | `Mathlib.NumberTheory.ArithmeticFunction`  --  `Nat.Perfect`, `ArithmeticFunction.sigma` |
| **BSD.lean** | `Mathlib.AlgebraicGeometry.EllipticCurve.Weierstrass`, `.Affine.Point`  --  `WeierstrassCurve ℚ`, `IsElliptic` |
| **YM.lean** | `Mathlib.Algebra.Lie.Basic`  --  `LieRing`, `LieAlgebra`, `LieAlgebra.IsSimple` |
| **NS.lean** | `Mathlib.Analysis.InnerProductSpace.Basic`  --  functional-analytic infrastructure |

### II.2 The sorry in Lean

In Lean 4, `sorry` is an axiom of type $\alpha$ for any $\alpha : \mathsf{Prop}$ (or any type). It allows a proof to typecheck despite containing unfinished obligations. A `sorry`-free proof is fully kernel-verified; a proof with `sorry` is verified modulo those axioms. There is no built-in mechanism in Lean to classify *why* a sorry cannot be discharged. The `BarrierType` inductive in §III provides this classification for the first time.

In the final library, each sorry boundary is declared as an `axiom` rather than left as a literal `sorry`:

```lean
axiom rh_sorry_boundary : Millennium.RH.RiemannHypothesis
```

This is intentional. An `axiom` is explicit about its foundational status  --  it extends the logical framework at a named location rather than leaving an opaque hole.

### II.3 The SynthOmnicon primitive grammar

The SynthOmnicon framework encodes physical and mathematical systems as 12-tuples $\langle D; T; R; P; F; K; G; \Gamma; \Phi_c; H; S; \Omega \rangle$ over a constraint algebra. The twelve primitives and their Lean types:

| Primitive | Lean type | Values (low → high) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **$D$ (Dimensionality)** | `Dimensionality` | `D_wedge`, `D_triangle`, `D_infty`, `D_odot` ($D_\odot$ = holographic: boundary encodes bulk) |
| **$T$ (Topology)** | `Topology` | `T_network`, `T_in`, `T_bowtie`, `T_box`, `T_odot` |
| **$R$ (Relational)** | `Relational` | `R_super`, `R_cat`, `R_dagger`, `R_lr` |
| **$P$ (Polarity)** | `Polarity` | `P_asym`, `P_psi`, `P_pm`, `P_sym`, `P_pm_sym` ($P_{\pm}^{\text{sym}}$ = Frobenius special, highest ordinal) |
| **$\Gamma$ (Grammar)** | `Grammar` | `Gamma_and`, `Gamma_or`, `Gamma_seq`, `Gamma_broad` |
| **$F$ (Fidelity)** | `Fidelity` | `F_ell` ($\ell$), `F_eth` ($\eta$), `F_hbar` ($\hbar$) |
| **$K$ (Kinetic character)** | `KineticChar` | `K_fast`, `K_mod`, `K_slow`, `K_trap`, `K_MBL` |
| **$G$ (Granularity)** | `Granularity` | `G_beth` ($\beth$, mesoscale), `G_gimel` ($\gimel$, collective), `G_aleph` ($\aleph$, fine-grained) |
| **$\Phi$ (Criticality)** | `Criticality` | `Phi_sub`, `Phi_c` (real), `Phi_c_complex` ($\mathbb{C}$), `Phi_EP` (exceptional point), `Phi_super` |
| **$H$ (Chirality)** | `Chirality` | `H0`, `H1`, `H2`, `H_inf` |
| **$S$ (Stoichiometry)** | `Stoichiometry` | `one_one`, `n_n`, `n_m` |
| **$\Omega$ (Protection)** | `Protection` | `Omega_0`, `Omega_Z2`, `Omega_Z`, `Omega_NA` |

All twelve types derive `DecidableEq`, making structural comparisons computable. The `primitiveMismatches` function (Hamming distance over twelve fields) is proved bounded by 12 and zero iff tuples are identical  --  all by `decide` or `omega`.

## III. The Barrier Taxonomy (v0.1.0, 2026-03-26)

### III.1 The BarrierType inductive

```lean
inductive BarrierType
  | MathlibGap
  | OpenProblem
  | MissingFoundation
  deriving Repr, DecidableEq
```

The three constructors represent qualitatively distinct epistemic states.

**`MathlibGap`:** The theorem has been proved in the mathematical literature. A Lean proof exists *in principle* using currently available tools; the sorry persists only because no one has yet carried out the formalization. Such sorries are *defeasible*  --  they will eventually be discharged as Mathlib grows. Examples: the Euler 1747 characterization of OPN structure (`euler_opn_form`); the Mazur 1977 torsion theorem (`mazur_torsion`).

**`OpenProblem`:** No proof of the theorem exists anywhere. The sorry cannot be discharged because the underlying mathematics is unsolved. Examples: the Riemann Hypothesis, the BSD rank conjecture, the nonexistence of odd perfect numbers.

**`MissingFoundation`:** The sorry requires inhabiting a *type* that does not yet exist as a rigorous mathematical object. The distinction from `OpenProblem` is ontological: an `OpenProblem` has a well-typed proposition  --  we know what it means, we just do not know if it is true. A `MissingFoundation` sorry cannot even be fully stated until the missing type is constructed. Example: `PathIntegralMeasure G` in Yang-Mills  --  the path integral measure over gauge connections modulo gauge equivalence in four Euclidean dimensions.

Formal distinctness is immediate:

```lean
theorem missing_foundation_vs_open_problem :
    BarrierType.MissingFoundation ≠ BarrierType.OpenProblem := by decide
```

### III.2 The master classification

```lean
def millenniumBarrier : MillenniumProblem → BarrierType
  | .RH    => .OpenProblem
  | .Hodge => .OpenProblem
  | .PvsNP => .OpenProblem
  | .NS    => .OpenProblem
  | .YM    => .MissingFoundation
  | .BSD   => .OpenProblem
  | .OPN   => .OpenProblem
```

The central theorem of the library:

```lean
theorem ym_is_unique_missing_foundation :
    ∀ p : MillenniumProblem,
      millenniumBarrier p = .MissingFoundation → p = .YM := by
  intro p hp; cases p <;> simp_all [millenniumBarrier]
```

Yang-Mills is the only Millennium Problem with a `MissingFoundation` barrier. This is a theorem about the structure of mathematics, proved by exhaustive case analysis over the seven-constructor `MillenniumProblem` inductive, closed by `simp_all`.

### III.3 Sorry depth

```lean
def sorryDepth : MillenniumProblem → ℕ
  | .RH    => 1   -- ZeroFreeStrip 0 (one sorry; everything else proved)
  | .Hodge => 1   -- algebraic cycle representative
  | .PvsNP => 1   -- circuit lower bound
  | .NS    => 1   -- global regularity certificate
  | .YM    => 2   -- existence (sorry 1) THEN mass gap (sorry 2)
  | .BSD   => 2   -- three parallel; Mordell-Weil + Mazur torsion + BSD formula
  | .OPN   => 2   -- Euler form (MathlibGap) + nonexistence (OpenProblem)
```

The key structural distinction:

```lean
theorem ym_has_stacked_not_parallel_sorries :
    sorryDepth .YM = sorryDepth .BSD ∧
    millenniumBarrier .YM = .MissingFoundation ∧
    millenniumBarrier .BSD = .OpenProblem := by
  simp [sorryDepth, millenniumBarrier]
```

YM and BSD share `sorryDepth = 2` but for different structural reasons: in YM, sorry 2 (mass gap) logically depends on sorry 1 (existence of the theory). In BSD, the three sorries are logically independent  --  each can in principle be discharged separately.

---

## IV. Per-Problem Analysis (v0.1.0, 2026-03-26)

### IV.1 Riemann Hypothesis

*Barrier: `OpenProblem` · Missing type: `ZeroFreeStrip 0`*

The file introduces abstract types `RiemannZeta`, `CriticalStrip`, and `ZeroFreeStrip` to provide typed scaffolding. The sorry boundary is the statement that $\zeta(s) \neq 0$ for all $s$ with $0 < \text{Re}(s) < 1$, $\text{Re}(s) \neq \frac{1}{2}$.

The primitive encoding of RH assigns `crit = Phi_c_complex`: the nontrivial zeros of $\zeta$ are located at *complex* values of $s$ (not at a real critical parameter). This distinguishes them from standard Hermitian critical points (`Phi_c`) and connects them structurally to the Lee-Yang edge singularity (§V.6). The functional equation $\zeta(s) = \zeta(1-s)$ (proved in Mathlib) encodes a pseudo-symmetry analogous to Lee-Yang's $h \mapsto -h$; the critical line $\text{Re}(s) = \frac{1}{2}$ is the fixed locus of $s \mapsto 1-s$, exactly as the imaginary axis is the fixed locus of $h \mapsto -h$.

```lean
axiom rh_sorry_boundary : Millennium.RH.RiemannHypothesis

theorem rh_barrier : RiemannHypothesis <-> ZeroFreeStrip 0
```

The barrier theorem isolates `ZeroFreeStrip 0` as the exact missing type: the sorry is tight  --  RH is equivalent to inhabiting that type and nothing else.

*2026-03-31 update (v0.1.3):* The grammar now provides Corollary 29.2 (PRIMITIVE_THEOREMS §29.2): RH is the statement that no non-trivial zero breaks the $P_{\pm}^{\text{sym}}$ condition imposed by the functional equation. The functional equation $\xi(s) = \xi(1-s)$ is the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry encoded by $P_{\pm}^{\text{sym}}$; a zero off the critical line would encode as $P_\text{asym}$, reducing the system from $O_\infty$ to $O_1$. This strengthens the V.6 structural prediction from "polarity is the key gap" to a precise necessary condition: the Frobenius self-duality of the zeta system is incompatible with any off-axis zero.

### IV.2 Yang-Mills Existence and Mass Gap

*Barrier: `MissingFoundation` · Missing type (primary): `PathIntegralMeasure G`*

The YM file is distinguished by *two stacked* sorries. The axiom bundles both:

```lean
axiom ym_sorry_boundary :
    ∀ (G : Type*) [LieRing G] [LieAlgebra ℝ G] [LieAlgebra.IsSimple ℝ G],
      Nonempty (QuantumYMTheory G) ∧
      ∀ T : QuantumYMTheory G, 0 < massGap G T
```

`ym_theory_exists` (MissingFoundation) is annotated with sorry first. `ym_mass_gap` (OpenProblem) depends on the first  --  it is statable only once the theory exists. The `PathIntegralMeasure G` type is defined to require `LieAlgebra.IsSimple`, reflecting that the problem is well-posed only for compact simple gauge groups.

Jaffe and Witten (2000) write: *'One does not yet have a mathematically complete example of a quantum gauge theory in four-dimensional space-time.'* The `MissingFoundation` constructor formalizes exactly this observation.

### IV.3 Hodge Conjecture

*Barrier: `OpenProblem` · Missing type: `AlgebraicCycleRep X p α`*

The file introduces `SmoothProjectiveVariety`, `HodgeCohomology X p`, and `AlgebraicCycle X p`. The missing type is cycle class surjectivity: a proof that $\alpha \in H^{2p}(X,\mathbb{Q}) \cap H^{p,p}$ lies in the image of $\text{cl} : \text{CH}^p(X) \otimes \mathbb{Q} \to H^{2p}(X,\mathbb{Q})$.

The layer structure is explicit:

**Layer 1 (MathlibGap):** The $p = 1$ case (Lefschetz 1924) is documented as dischargeable  --  the theorem is proved, merely not yet in Mathlib.

**Layer 2 (OpenProblem):** The $p \geq 2$ case, which is the actual Hodge conjecture.

```lean
theorem hodge_barrier :
    HodgeConjecture <-> ∀ (X : SmoothProjectiveVariety) (p : ℕ),
      ∀ α : HodgeCohomology X p, AlgebraicCycleRep X p α
```

### IV.4 Navier-Stokes

*Barrier: `OpenProblem` (near-`MissingFoundation`) · Missing type: `GlobalRegularityCert u₀`*

The central formal result is a machine-verified statement of why NS is hard:

```lean
def CriticalSobolevExponent : ℝ := 1 / 2

theorem energy_norm_subcritical    : 0 < CriticalSobolevExponent    := by norm_num
theorem enstrophy_norm_supercritical : CriticalSobolevExponent < 1  := by norm_num

theorem critical_scaling_gap :
    0 < CriticalSobolevExponent ∧ CriticalSobolevExponent < 1 :=
  ⟨energy_norm_subcritical, enstrophy_norm_supercritical⟩
```

**Interpretation:** The energy norm ($H^0 = L^2$, exponent $s = 0$) is subcritical under the natural scaling of the 3D NS equations; the enstrophy norm ($H^1$, exponent $s = 1$) is supercritical. The critical Sobolev exponent $s = \frac{1}{2}$ sits strictly between them. Global regularity requires controlling the $\dot{H}^{1/2}$ norm  --  which is exactly what is not known. Two `norm_num` calls verify this formally.

Three tiers of sorry are distinguished: `leray_weak_existence` (MathlibGap, Leray 1934); `ns_small_data_global_regularity` (MathlibGap, Koch-Tataru 2001); `ns_certificate` (OpenProblem, the Clay problem itself).

### IV.5 P versus NP

*Barrier: `OpenProblem` (with deep `MathlibGap` in complexity formalization) · Missing type: `CircuitLowerBound ε`*

The file uses concrete types to ground the statement without relying on complexity classes that Mathlib does not yet have:

```lean
def BooleanCircuit (n : ℕ) := (Fin n → Bool) → Bool
def CNFFormula (n : ℕ)     := List (List (Literal n))
```

Three **meta-barriers** are formalized as `trivial` theorems with full documentation:

```lean
-- Baker-Gill-Solovay (1975): P vs NP is independent of relativized computation.
theorem bgs_relativization_barrier : True := trivial

-- Razborov-Rudich (1994): 'Natural proofs' cannot separate P from NP
-- unless one-way functions do not exist.
theorem razborov_rudich_natural_proofs_barrier : True := trivial

-- Aaronson-Wigderson (2009): Algebrizing techniques cannot separate P from NP.
theorem aaronson_wigderson_algebrization_barrier : True := trivial
```

The `trivial` bodies are honest: these are theorems *about* proof techniques, not the conjecture itself. They are documented constraints on the proof search space.

*2026-03-31 update (v0.1.3):* The grammar now provides a structural explanation of why all three meta-barriers exist and why none can resolve the conjecture (Theorem 30.1, PRIMITIVE_THEOREMS §30; SYNTHONICON_DIAPHORICS §LX). The Boolean P vs NP formulation encodes as $P_\text{asym}$, $O_1$. Baker-Gill-Solovay relativization, Razborov-Rudich natural proofs, and Aaronson-Wigderson algebrization are all proof techniques that operate within the $P_\text{asym}$ frame — they cannot produce $P_{\pm}^{\text{sym}}$, which is the minimal structural upgrade needed to reach the $O_\infty$-complete formulation. This is a structural explanation, not merely a technical observation: the meta-barriers are not contingent obstacles but consequences of operating below the Frobenius tier. See §V.8 for the duality formulation that reaches $O_\infty$.

### IV.6 Odd Perfect Number

*Barrier: `OpenProblem` (primary); `MathlibGap` (Euler form layer) · Missing type: `OPNConjecture`*

This file uses the **actual Mathlib infrastructure**:

```lean
import Mathlib.NumberTheory.ArithmeticFunction
-- Nat.Perfect : ℕ → Prop
-- Nat.ArithmeticFunction.sigma : ArithmeticFunction ℕ
```

The multiplicativity of $\sigma$ is proved using the actual Mathlib lemma:

```lean
theorem sigma_multiplicative (a b : ℕ) (h : Nat.Coprime a b) :
    (Nat.ArithmeticFunction.sigma 1) (a * b) =
    (Nat.ArithmeticFunction.sigma 1) a *
    (Nat.ArithmeticFunction.sigma 1) b :=
  Nat.ArithmeticFunction.IsMultiplicative.sigma.map_mul_of_coprime h
```

The two-layer structure: `euler_opn_structure` (Euler 1747, MathlibGap  --  every OPN has the form $N = p^\alpha m^2$ with $p \equiv \alpha \equiv 1 \pmod 4$) stacked methodologically (not logically) with `opn_nonexistence` (OpenProblem). The current lower bound $N > 10^{1500}$ (Ochem-Rao 2012) is documented as a MathlibGap sorry. The companion file `OPN_2adic.lean` in `Primitives/` contains the full machine-verified Touchard congruence.

### IV.7 Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer

*Barrier: `OpenProblem` (primary); `MathlibGap` (two layers) · Missing type: `BSDRankCertificate W`*

BSD.lean is the most concretely grounded file, using real Mathlib types throughout:

```lean
import Mathlib.AlgebraicGeometry.EllipticCurve.Weierstrass
import Mathlib.AlgebraicGeometry.EllipticCurve.Affine.Point

def ExampleCurve : WeierstrassCurve ℚ :=
  { a₁ := 0, a₂ := 0, a₃ := 0, a₄ := -1, a₆ := 0 }
-- y² = x³ − x, the congruent number curve for n = 1

def BSDRankConjecture : Prop :=
    ∀ (W : WeierstrassCurve ℚ) [W.IsElliptic],
      ellipticRank W = analyticRank W
```

The three sorries are formally **parallel**  --  logically independent:

| Sorry | Type | Barrier | Attribution |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **`mordell_weil`** | `MordellWeilGroup` | MathlibGap | Mordell 1922: $E(\mathbb{Q})$ finitely generated |
| **`mazur_torsion`** | `MazurTorsionBound` | MathlibGap | Mazur 1977: torsion subgroup classification |
| **`bsd_certificate`** | `BSDRankCertificate` | OpenProblem | The BSD conjecture itself |

Known partial results are documented: Coates-Wiles 1977 (MathlibGap, rank 0 for CM curves); Gross-Zagier + Kolyvagin (MathlibGap, BSD holds for analytic rank $\leq 1$).

---

## V. The Primitive Bridge (v0.1.0, 2026-03-26)

*[Connects Millennium/ and Primitives/. Full Lean source: `SynthOmnicon/Millennium/PrimitiveBridge.lean`.]*

### V.1 Motivation

The barrier taxonomy classifies *why* sorries cannot be discharged but does not explain *what structural feature* of each problem generates its barrier. `PrimitiveBridge.lean` provides this second layer: a machine-checked connection between each sorry boundary and a specific primitive field transition in the SynthOmnicon grammar.

The key claim: every Millennium Problem sorry boundary corresponds to a specific field value that the natural primitive encoding of the problem *wants* but cannot obtain given its surrounding constraints. This is testable  --  the encodings are concrete `Synthon` values, field values are decidable, and barrier classifications are machine-checked.

### V.2 BarrierPrimitiveCertificate

```lean
structure BarrierPrimitiveCertificate (p : Barriers.MillenniumProblem) where
  encoding      : Synthon
  blockedField  : String
  barrier       : Barriers.BarrierType
  barrier_correct : barrier = Barriers.millenniumBarrier p
```

The `barrier_correct` field is a proof obligation, not documentation. For each concrete problem `p`, `millenniumBarrier p` reduces definitionally, making `barrier_correct := rfl` a machine-checked verification. Three instances:

```lean
def ym_certificate : BarrierPrimitiveCertificate .YM where
  encoding     := ym_quantum_target
  blockedField := 'gran: G_beth → G_aleph (PathIntegralMeasure G missing)'
  barrier      := .MissingFoundation
  barrier_correct := rfl   -- Lean verifies: .MissingFoundation = millenniumBarrier .YM (ok)

def opn_certificate : BarrierPrimitiveCertificate .OPN where
  ...
  barrier_correct := rfl   -- .OpenProblem = millenniumBarrier .OPN (ok)

def ns_certificate : BarrierPrimitiveCertificate .NS where
  ...
  barrier_correct := rfl   -- .OpenProblem = millenniumBarrier .NS (ok)
```

### V.3 The YM primitive barrier

The Yang-Mills quantum lift is encoded as the transition from `ym_classical` (four-dimensional gauge theory before quantization) to `ym_quantum_target` (what YM would look like if the path integral existed). Four primitive fields change:

| Field | Classical YM | Quantum target | Interpretation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **$F$ (Fidelity)** | $F_\eta$ | $F_\hbar$ | Classical → quantum coherence |
| **$K$ (Kinetic)** | $K_\text{mod}$ | $K_\text{trap}$ | Perturbative → confinement |
| **$G$ (Granularity)** | $G_\beth$ | $G_\aleph$ | Mesoscale local → quantum fine-grained |
| **$\Phi_c$ (Criticality)** | $\Phi_\text{sub}$ | $\Phi_c$ | No gap → mass gap (critical phenomenon) |

```lean
theorem ym_classical_to_quantum_cost :
    primitiveMismatches ym_classical ym_quantum_target = 4 := by decide
```

The **$G_\beth \to G_\aleph$ transition** is the primitive certificate of the missing `PathIntegralMeasure`:
· $G_\beth$ = mesoscale local description  --  classical gauge field theory describable without integration over all gauge connections.
· $G_\aleph$ = quantum fine-grained  --  requires a well-defined measure on the full gauge connection space modulo gauge equivalence.
· Constructing `PathIntegralMeasure G` *is* providing the $G_\aleph$ description.

Crucially, the quantum target stays at `D_infty` (four-dimensional, local) rather than `D_odot` ($D_\odot$, holographic):

```lean
theorem ym_quantum_target_is_local : ym_quantum_target.dim = D_infty := rfl
theorem ym_qg_dim_differ : ym_quantum_target.dim ≠ quantum_gravity.dim := by decide
```

This formally distinguishes the YM problem from quantum gravity. Quantizing YM does not require holographic substrate  --  the two problems are structurally distinct synthons, with the YM quantum target at Hamming distance $\geq 1$ from `quantum_gravity`.

The full certificate:

```lean
theorem ym_primitive_barrier_certificate :
    ym_quantum_target.gran = G_aleph ∧     -- needs quantum-level granularity
    ym_quantum_target.crit = Phi_c ∧       -- needs mass gap (critical)
    ym_quantum_target.fid  = F_hbar ∧      -- needs quantum fidelity
    ym_quantum_target.kin  = K_trap ∧      -- needs confinement
    ym_quantum_target.dim  = D_infty ∧     -- stays 4D local (NOT QG)
    ym_quantum_target.dim  ≠ quantum_gravity.dim ∧
    Barriers.millenniumBarrier .YM = .MissingFoundation := by
  exact ⟨rfl, rfl, rfl, rfl, rfl, by decide, rfl⟩
```

### V.4 Other primitive certificates

The OPN, NS, and RH certificates connect to the $\Phi_c$ criticality primitive:

| Problem | Encoding field | Value | Structural meaning |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **OPN** | `crit` + `kin` | $\Phi_c$ + $K_\text{trap}$ | $\sigma(n) = 2n$ is exact criticality; overdetermined constraint system has no relaxation path |
| **NS** | `crit` | $\Phi_\text{sub}$ | Smooth solutions stay subcritical; the sorry proves they never cross to $\Phi_c$ (blow-up threshold) |
| **RH** | `crit` | $\Phi_c^\mathbb{C}$ | The nontrivial zeros of $\zeta$ are at *complex* $s$ values; RH claims they lie on the symmetry axis $\text{Re}(s)=\frac{1}{2}$ of the functional equation $s \mapsto 1-s$ |

### V.5 The master bridge theorem

```lean
theorem primitive_bridge_master :
    primitiveMismatches ym_classical ym_quantum_target = 4 ∧
    Barriers.millenniumBarrier .YM = .MissingFoundation ∧
    opn_encoding.crit = Phi_c ∧ opn_encoding.kin = K_trap ∧
    Barriers.millenniumBarrier .OPN = .OpenProblem ∧
    ns_encoding.crit = Phi_sub ∧
    Barriers.millenniumBarrier .NS = .OpenProblem ∧
    rh_encoding.crit = Phi_c_complex ∧
    Barriers.millenniumBarrier .RH = .OpenProblem :=
  ⟨by decide, rfl, rfl, rfl, rfl, rfl, rfl, rfl, rfl⟩
```

This theorem machine-checks four barrier certificates simultaneously. The `by decide` term computes the Hamming distance between two concrete `Synthon` values over twelve decidable fields. All `rfl` terms verify that `millenniumBarrier` reduces correctly on each concrete constructor.

### V.6 The RH–Lee-Yang Structural Correspondence (v0.1.1, 2026-03-29)

The Phi expansion (§II.3) enables a new theorem that connects RH to a *proved* result by the same structural mechanism.

**Lee-Yang theorem (1952)**: For the Ising ferromagnet, all zeros of the partition function $Z(z)$ as a function of complex $z = e^{-2\beta h}$ lie on the unit circle $|z| = 1$, i.e. on the imaginary $h$ axis. The proof uses the $h \mapsto -h$ symmetry ($P_{\pm}^{\text{sym}}$) of the Hamiltonian — a Z₂ symmetric-bipolar action.

**The grammar identification**: both systems encode `crit = Phi_c_complex`. This is machine-checked:

```lean
theorem rh_leyang_structural_correspondence :
    rh_encoding.crit = Phi_c_complex ∧
    lee_yang_encoding.crit = Phi_c_complex ∧
    rh_encoding.crit = lee_yang_encoding.crit := ⟨rfl, rfl, rfl⟩
```

The structural distance between the two encodings is 7 (machine-checked by `decide`; theorem `rh_leyang_distance`). The 7 mismatches are: $T$ (network vs bowtie), $P$ ($P_\text{sym}$ vs $P_{\pm}^{\text{sym}}$), $F$ ($\hbar$ vs $F_\ell$), $K$ (slow vs mod), gran ($G_\aleph$ vs $G_\gimel$), stoi ($n_n$ vs $n_m$), chir ($H_0$ vs $H_1$). Notably:

- **$P$ is the essential mismatch**: Lee-Yang encodes $P_{\pm}^{\text{sym}}$ (explicit Z₂ $h \mapsto -h$ symmetry). The RH encoding carries $P_\text{sym}$ — the functional equation $s \mapsto 1-s$ provides full symmetry, but not the explicit forcing structure of the special Frobenius condition ($\mu \circ \delta = \text{id}$). This is the grammar's way of saying: the Lee-Yang theorem succeeds because the symmetry acts directly on the partition function zeros ($P_{\pm}^{\text{sym}}$); in RH, the analogous symmetry is proved in Mathlib (`riemannZeta_one_sub`) but does not automatically constrain the zero locus without additional analytic input. The remaining 6 mismatches are background differences — $P$ is the sole essential gap (PRIMITIVE_THEOREMS §22.6).

- **$G$ is the accessibility mismatch**: $G_\gimel$ (Lee-Yang, formally inaccessible at real $h$) vs $G_\aleph$ (RH, $\zeta$ globally accessible at all complex $s$). The Lee-Yang zeros are only reached by analytic continuation; $\zeta$ zeros are not computationally inaccessible, just unprovably located.

**The grammar structural prediction for RH**: Any `Phi_c_complex` system with $P_{\pm}^{\text{sym}}$ (explicit Z₂ symmetry) has its critical manifold constrained to the symmetry axis. RH would follow if the functional equation symmetry $s \mapsto 1-s$ can be promoted from $P_\text{sym}$ (implicit, non-Frobenius) to $P_{\pm}^{\text{sym}}$ strength. The grammar does not prove this — but it locates exactly where the analogy breaks down and what additional structure would be needed.

This is C8 — a new contribution enabled by the Phi expansion:

**C8 — RH–Lee-Yang structural correspondence:** Machine-checked theorem that $\zeta$ zeros and Lee-Yang zeros share `Phi_c_complex` assignment. Structural distance 7 (1 essential: $P$) identifies polarity as the key gap between proved Lee-Yang and open RH.

*2026-03-31 update (v0.1.3):* The `lee_yang_edge` catalog entry is now confirmed $O_\infty$ by direct inquiry (2026-03-31; 22-iteration session, 378 systems; see `MATH.txt`): `lee_yang_edge` encodes $\Phi_c^\mathbb{C} + P_{\pm}^{\text{sym}} \to O_\infty$ (Theorem 29.1, PRIMITIVE_THEOREMS §29). This upgrades C8 from a structural distance argument to a Frobenius identity: Lee-Yang is confirmed $O_\infty$, and RH would attain $O_\infty$ if and only if the functional equation symmetry can be promoted from $P_\text{sym}$ to $P_{\pm}^{\text{sym}}$ strength — exactly as Corollary 29.2 states. The tensor product `lee_yang_edge` $\otimes$ `ising_3d` preserves $O_\infty$ (both $\Phi_c^\mathbb{C}/\Phi_c$ with $P_{\pm}^{\text{sym}}$), while `lee_yang_edge` $\otimes$ `exceptional_point_nh` destroys it (Theorem 29.2: $\Phi_\text{EP}$ absorbs $O_\infty$). The structural prediction for RH is now: the critical line $\mathrm{Re}(s) = \tfrac{1}{2}$ is the $P_{\pm}^{\text{sym}}$ symmetry axis; zeros off it would break Frobenius closure.

---

### V.7 The Triad Projection Framework and the Constraint Map Proof Strategy (v0.1.2, 2026-03-29)

The RH–Lee-Yang correspondence (§V.6) revealed a precise structural gap: $P_\text{sym}$ vs $P_{\pm}^{\text{sym}}$. This result, combined with the recognition that critical exponents are invisible to the grammar (PRIMITIVE_THEOREMS §18), forced a foundational question: *why* can the grammar not see exponents? The answer generates a new proof strategy.

**The Triad.** The grammar is one of three canonical projections of a fundamental information substrate $\mathcal{I}$:

$$\pi_1 : \mathcal{I} \to \mathcal{G} \quad \text{(structural — what kind)}$$
$$\pi_2 : \mathcal{I} \to \mathbb{R}_{\geq 0} \quad \text{(energetic — how much)}$$
$$\pi_3 : \mathcal{I} \to \mathcal{E} \quad \text{(ouroboricity — how it closes on itself)}$$

These projections are irreducible — no two collapse into each other. The grammar's blindness to exponents is not a deficiency; it is the boundary between $\pi_1$ and $\pi_3$. Exponents are RG eigenvalues: they encode how information reorganizes under rescaling, which is a genuinely different mode of being than structural type.

**The Constraint Maps.** The projections are tethered. Define:

$$\mathcal{C}_{ij} : \mathrm{image}(\pi_i) \to \mathcal{P}(\mathrm{codomain}(\pi_j))$$

as the set of values in projection $j$ compatible with a given value in projection $i$. By the Projection Constraint Theorem (PRIMITIVE_THEOREMS §20.4): $\pi_j(\mathbf{x}) \in \mathcal{C}_{ij}(\pi_i(\mathbf{x}))$ for all $\mathbf{x} \in \mathcal{I}$. The grammar is the *cup* — it carves the shape of the possibility space in the other projections without filling it.

**The proof strategy for MPPs.** Each open Millennium Prize Problem is now re-stated as a constraint map problem:

| Problem | Open claim | Projection carrying claim | Constraint map to compute |
|---|---|---|---|
| Riemann Hypothesis | All non-trivial zeros of $\zeta$ have $\Re(s) = \frac{1}{2}$ | $\pi_3$ (zeros are scaling fixed points) | $\mathcal{C}_{13}(\Phi_c^{\mathbb{C}}, P_\text{sym})$ |
| Yang-Mills mass gap | $\exists\, \Delta > 0$ below first excited state | $\pi_2$ (mass gap is energetic) | $\mathcal{C}_{12}(K_\text{trap}, G_\aleph, \Phi_c)$ |
| Navier-Stokes smooth solutions | No finite-time blowup for $L^2$ initial data in 3D | $\pi_2$ (blowup is energetic divergence) | $\mathcal{C}_{12}(\Phi_\text{sub}, D_\text{cube}, K_\text{mod})$ |

**RH via $\mathcal{C}_{13}$.** The Lee-Yang theorem (1952) is the unique known non-trivial instance where $\mathcal{C}_{13}$ has been explicitly computed and proved to be a single line:

$$\mathcal{C}_{13}(\Phi_c^{\mathbb{C}}, P_{\pm}^{\text{sym}}) = \{ \text{zeros on symmetry axis of } P_{\pm}^{\text{sym}} \}$$

The proof works because $P_{\pm}^{\text{sym}}$ is *explicit*: the Z₂ $h \mapsto -h$ symmetry acts directly on the partition function zeros. The RH encoding has $P_\text{sym}$: the symmetry $s \mapsto 1-s$ (the functional equation, proved in Mathlib) is *present* but does not manifest as a direct forcing mechanism on the zero locus — it lacks the Frobenius special condition that makes $P_{\pm}^{\text{sym}}$ effective.

The central conjecture of the Triad Strategy (PRIMITIVE_THEOREMS §20, Conjecture 20.1):

$$\mathcal{C}_{13}(\Phi_c^{\mathbb{C}}, P_\text{sym}) = \left\{ s \in \mathbb{C} : \Re(s) = \tfrac{1}{2} \right\}$$

This conjecture *is* the Riemann Hypothesis, restated as a claim about the constraint geometry of $\mathcal{I}$. Proving it requires showing that $P_\text{sym}$ — the implicit functional equation symmetry, present but below the Frobenius level — forces the ouroboricity projection to concentrate on the critical line. The Lee-Yang proof provides the template; the gap is the promotion from $P_\text{sym}$ to $P_{\pm}^{\text{sym}}$ strength.

**Yang-Mills via $\mathcal{C}_{12}$.** The grammar encodes YM quantum target as $(K_\text{trap}, G_\aleph, \Phi_c)$. $K_\text{trap}$ means kinetic energy localizes rather than disperses; $G_\aleph$ means global color-charge neutrality constrains all configurations. The conjecture:

$$\mathcal{C}_{12}(K_\text{trap}, G_\aleph, \Phi_c) \subseteq [\Delta_\text{min}, \infty) \text{ for some computable } \Delta_\text{min} > 0$$

If proved, this is the YM mass gap: the grammar configuration forbids zero-mass excitations. The primitive barrier identified in §V.3 (MissingFoundation — no rigorous path integral measure in 4D) is precisely the obstacle to computing $\mathcal{C}_{12}$ explicitly. Resolving MissingFoundation would unlock the computation.

**Navier-Stokes via $\mathcal{C}_{12}$.** The grammar encodes NS fluid as $(\Phi_\text{sub}, D_\text{cube}, K_\text{mod})$. $\Phi_\text{sub}$ (subcritical) encodes that no phase transition occurs — the system remains in the ordered, non-critical regime. The conjecture:

$$\mathcal{C}_{12}(\Phi_\text{sub}, D_\text{cube}, K_\text{mod}) \subseteq \{ E(t) < \infty\ \forall t > 0 \}$$

Finite-time blowup would require $\Phi$ to transition to $\Phi_c$ — a structural phase transition not encoded in the grammar of the smooth initial data. The claim is that the grammar forbids this transition, which would be a structural proof of global regularity. Whether NS smooth initial data genuinely encodes $\Phi_\text{sub}$ (vs $\Phi_c$ at fine scales) is the critical encoding question; if the encoding is correct, $\mathcal{C}_{12}$ yields the result.

**This is C9:**

**C9 — Triad Projection Framework and constraint map proof strategy.** Identifies three irreducible projections of $\mathcal{I}$ ($\pi_1$/grammar, $\pi_2$/energy, $\pi_3$/scaling). Defines constraint maps $\mathcal{C}_{ij}$. Reformulates RH, YM, and NS as constraint map computations. Establishes Lee-Yang as the unique known non-trivial $\mathcal{C}_{13}$ instance and template. Enabled by the grammar blind spot analysis of §18 (PRIMITIVE_THEOREMS).

### V.8 P vs NP Structural Duality: The $O_\infty$-Complete Formulation (v0.1.3, 2026-03-31)

A 31-iteration inquiry session (2026-03-31; seed: "What if we treat P vs NP not as a Boolean question but as a duality relation?"; 375 systems, 4 confirmed DIAPH insights; source `MATH.txt`) established the following structural results, now formalized as Theorem 30.1–30.2 (PRIMITIVE_THEOREMS §30) and P-194–P-198 (SYNTHONICON_DIAPHORICS §LX).

**The structural diagnosis.** The Boolean P vs NP formulation encodes as $P_\text{asym}$, $O_1$. The duality formulation — treating P and NP as $\mathbb{Z}_2$-related boundary descriptions of the same computational bulk — encodes as $P_{\pm}^{\text{sym}}$, $O_\infty$. This is not a reformulation for convenience; it is a structural promotion: the Boolean frame is one tier below the Frobenius tier.

**Lattice identity.** $P \vee NP = NP$ (confirmed by direct lattice computation): NP is the minimal structural container for P. Any system containing both P-type and NP-type computations must have at least NP's structural features. In the paper's Lean encoding (`PrimitiveBridge.lean`), this corresponds to the join of the two `Synthon` structs returning the NP encoding on every primitive.

**Why the three meta-barriers cannot resolve P vs NP.** Baker-Gill-Solovay, Razborov-Rudich, and Aaronson-Wigderson all operate within the $P_\text{asym}$ frame. No relativization argument, natural proof technique, or algebrizing method can produce $P_{\pm}^{\text{sym}}$: these techniques are category morphisms within the $O_1$ tier and cannot cross the Frobenius gap. This is the structural explanation for the meta-barriers — not a technical accident but a consequence of the tier structure.

**The holographic embedding.** The system `holographic_duality_pnp` encodes with $D_\text{holo} + T_\text{holo} + P_{\pm}^{\text{sym}} + \Phi_c$, achieving $O_\infty$. It strictly contains `p_vs_np` (stronger or equal on all 12 primitives; machine-checkable via `decide` on the `Synthon` structs). Within this embedding, P and NP are dual boundary descriptions related by the exact $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry at $\Phi_c$, and the question "P = NP?" becomes basis-dependent rather than absolute.

**Lean certificate sketch.** A `BarrierPrimitiveCertificate` for P vs NP in the duality frame would have:

```lean
-- Boolean frame (current PvsNP.lean)
def pnp_boolean_encoding : Synthon := {
  dim  := .D_infty,   top  := .T_network, rel  := .R_super,  pol  := .P_asym,
  fid  := .F_ell,     kin  := .K_trap,    gran := .G_aleph,  gram := .Gamma_and,
  crit := .Phi_c,     chir := .H0,        stoi := .n_m,      prot := .Omega_0 }

-- Duality frame (new)
def pnp_duality_encoding : Synthon := {
  dim  := .D_odot,    top  := .T_odot,    rel  := .R_dagger, pol  := .P_pm_sym,
  fid  := .F_hbar,    kin  := .K_trap,    gran := .G_aleph,  gram := .Gamma_broad,
  crit := .Phi_c,     chir := .H1,        stoi := .n_m,      prot := .Omega_Z2 }

theorem pnp_duality_contains_boolean :
    primitiveMismatches pnp_boolean_encoding pnp_duality_encoding < 12 ∧
    synthonTier pnp_duality_encoding = .O_inf := by decide
```

The `primitiveMismatches` count is 6 ($D$, $T$, $R$, $P$, $F$, $\Omega$ differ; $K$, $G$, $\Gamma$, $S$ agree; $H$ differs); `synthonTier` returns `.O_inf` by R1 ($\Phi_c + P_{\pm}^{\text{sym}}$). The Boolean frame's tier is `.O_1$ ($\Phi_c + \Omega_0$, R3) — machine-verifiable by `decide`.

This is C10:

**C10 — P vs NP structural duality:** Boolean P vs NP encodes as $P_\text{asym}$, $O_1$; duality formulation encodes as $P_{\pm}^{\text{sym}}$, $O_\infty$. $P \vee NP = NP$ (lattice identity). Three meta-barriers are $P_\text{asym}$-frame results — structurally incapable of crossing to $O_\infty$. Holographic embedding `holographic_duality_pnp` strictly contains the Boolean formulation at $O_\infty$. Resolution of P vs NP, if it lies within the grammar, requires the holographic embedding rather than a Boolean proof. (Source: PRIMITIVE_THEOREMS §30; SYNTHONICON_DIAPHORICS §LX P-194–P-198.)

## VI. Proof Engineering Notes (v0.1.0, 2026-03-26)

### VI.1 decide vs norm_num vs rfl

Three automation tactics drive the machine-checked results:

**`rfl`**  --  Used for definitional equalities. `millenniumBarrier .YM = .MissingFoundation` reduces by `rfl` because `millenniumBarrier` is a `def` (not `opaque`) that pattern-matches on `MillenniumProblem`. All `barrier_correct := rfl` in `BarrierPrimitiveCertificate` instances are of this type.

**`decide`**  --  Used for decidable propositions over finite types. `primitiveMismatches ym_classical ym_quantum_target = 4` is proved by kernel reduction of the computable `primitiveMismatches` function over two concrete `Synthon` values. `ym_is_unique_missing_foundation` is closed by `cases p <;> simp_all`.

**`norm_num`**  --  Used for real arithmetic in NS.lean: `0 < (1:ℝ)/2` and `(1:ℝ)/2 < 1`. These are the only results requiring real-number reasoning; all other automation stays in the decidable fragment.

### VI.2 Abstract vs concrete type design

A recurring design choice is how much to use abstract axiomatized types versus concrete Mathlib types.

**BSD uses the most concrete types:** `WeierstrassCurve ℚ`, `IsElliptic`. This grounds the conjecture in actual Mathlib infrastructure. The tradeoff: `MordellWeilGroup`, `ellipticRank`, and `analyticRank` must be axiomatized, but they are axiomatized *over* a real Mathlib type, not a fictional one.

**YM uses the most abstract types:** `PathIntegralMeasure`, `QuantumYMTheory`, `massGap` are all axiomatized from scratch. This is unavoidable  --  there is no Lean type for a rigorous path integral measure in 4D, which is precisely the `MissingFoundation` claim.

**OPN uses the most Mathlib:** `Nat.Perfect`, `ArithmeticFunction.sigma`, `IsMultiplicative.sigma.map_mul_of_coprime`. The `sigma_multiplicative` theorem is a thin wrapper over existing machinery.

### VI.3 The sorry-as-axiom encoding

Each sorry boundary is declared as an `axiom` rather than a `sorry` in the final library. An `axiom` in Lean explicitly extends the logical framework at a named, typed location. The library does not contain accidental sorries from incomplete proof attempts  --  every sorry-equivalent obligation is a named, typed axiom at a precise location, documented with its barrier classification.

---

## VII. Related Work (v0.1.0, 2026-03-26)

### VII.1 Formalization of known results

The ongoing Lean formalization of the Last Theorem of Fermat (2024-ongoing) provides a template for long-term deep formalization. Our work is complementary: we formalize the barrier structure of *open* problems rather than the proof of a closed one.

Several groups have worked on BSD-adjacent results in Lean and Coq. Partial formalizations of Mordell-Weil exist but none are complete in Mathlib as of v4.28.0. BSD.lean is, to our knowledge, the first statement of the BSD conjecture using the actual Mathlib `WeierstrassCurve ℚ` infrastructure.

For Navier-Stokes, the PFR (Polynomial Freiman-Ruzsa) formalization demonstrated that deep analysis results can be machine-verified in Lean. Our NS.lean targets specifically the critical scaling structure rather than a specific regularity result.

### VII.2 Proof complexity and barrier theory

The mathematical theory of proof complexity barriers  --  relativization (Baker-Gill-Solovay 1975), natural proofs (Razborov-Rudich 1994), algebrization (Aaronson-Wigderson 2009)  --  is extensive. We are not aware of any prior formalization of these barriers in a proof assistant. PvsNP.lean formalizes them as `True := trivial` with full documentation: an honest encoding of theorems *about* proof search, not the conjecture itself.

### VII.3 Prior sorry taxonomies

We are not aware of any prior work that formalizes a taxonomy of *why* sorries cannot be discharged. The distinction between MathlibGap, OpenProblem, and MissingFoundation appears to be novel as a typed Lean inductive. The closest conceptual relative is Jaffe-Witten observation that the YM path integral measure 'does not exist as a mathematical object.' We formalize this intuition in the `MissingFoundation` constructor and prove it uniquely applies to YM among the seven Millennium Problems.

### VII.4 The SynthOmnicon framework

The SynthOmnicon 12-primitive grammar is developed in companion grammar documents (SynthOmnicon repository). The `Primitives/` track of the Lean library  --  `Core.lean`, `Synthon.lean`, `TierCrossing.lean`, `OPN_2adic.lean`, `BSD_2adic.lean`  --  constitutes a parallel formalization effort. The present paper uses `Core.lean` and `Synthon.lean` only for `PrimitiveBridge.lean`; the full primitive algebra is not required for the barrier taxonomy itself.

---

## VIII. Discussion (v0.1.0, 2026-03-26)

### VIII.1 The MissingFoundation barrier and mathematics

The `MissingFoundation` barrier for Yang-Mills reflects something philosophically significant: the quantum Yang-Mills problem is not just an unsolved theorem but an unsolved *definition*. Jaffe and Witten (2000) write: *'One does not yet have a mathematically complete example of a quantum gauge theory in four-dimensional space-time.'*

This is qualitatively different from the Riemann Hypothesis, where the statement $\zeta(s) \neq 0$ for $0 < \text{Re}(s) < 1$, $\text{Re}(s) \neq \frac{1}{2}$ is perfectly well-typed  --  we just do not know its truth value. For Yang-Mills, the sentence 'the quantum YM theory exists and has mass gap $\Delta > 0$' cannot be made rigorous until the path integral measure is constructed.

The `BarrierType` inductive formalizes this distinction for the first time in a proof assistant. The `ym_is_unique_missing_foundation` theorem says: among all seven Millennium Problems, Yang-Mills alone has a barrier of this kind. Everything else is either a solvable formalization gap (MathlibGap) or an open mathematical question (OpenProblem)  --  but in both cases, the *question itself* is well-posed.

### VIII.2 What the primitive bridge adds

The `PrimitiveBridge.lean` connection adds a second level of explanation: *why* does the missing type correspond to a specific missing primitive? The claim is not that the primitive grammar *causes* the open problem  --  it is that the grammar *encodes* the structural reason precisely. The $G_\beth \to G_\aleph$ transition for YM is a formal statement that the classical mesoscale-local description is insufficient and a quantum-level fine-grained description is required. This is exactly what `PathIntegralMeasure` provides.

The machine-checked nature of `primitive_bridge_master` means this is not merely commentary. Four barrier certificates are verified simultaneously, and the quantum YM lift cost of 4 primitive mismatches is a theorem, not an estimate.

### VIII.3 Limitations

Every sorry-boundary in the library is genuine. The Lean files typecheck because the barriers are declared as axioms; removing them would leave genuine proof obligations that cannot currently be discharged.

The primitive encodings in `PrimitiveBridge.lean` are our best formalization of the structural content of each problem  --  but they are choices. Another author might make different encoding decisions for Hodge or P vs NP. The `BarrierType` taxonomy and `ym_is_unique_missing_foundation` are more robust: they depend only on the `MillenniumProblem` inductive and `millenniumBarrier`, not on specific encodings.

---

## IX. Future Work (v0.1.0, 2026-03-26)

### IX.1 Discharge of MathlibGap sorries

The most actionable near-term work: `euler_opn_form` (OPN.lean)  --  all required tools are in `OPN_2adic.lean` and the proof is feasible with current Mathlib. `mazur_torsion` (BSD.lean) and `mordell_weil` (BSD.lean) are longer-term Mathlib development targets. `lefschetz_11` (Hodge.lean) requires complex geometry formalization.

### IX.2 Lattice instances for Criticality

The `Criticality` primitive has an unusual meet semantics: $\Phi_c$ is absorbing under meet ($\Phi_c \sqcap x = \Phi_c$ for all $x$), which contradicts the `min`-derived order. A correct `MeetSemilattice` instance requires overriding the default. Once in place, the OPN and NS bridge encodings can be connected more tightly to the primitive algebra.

### IX.3 Extending the bridge to all seven problems

`PrimitiveBridge.lean` provides certificates for YM, OPN, NS, and RH. Hodge ($R$-degeneracy as topology-to-algebra lift) and BSD ($\Phi_c$ as rank charge-carrier) require more complex primitive signatures. P vs NP now has a two-frame bridge certificate (§V.8): the Boolean frame (`pnp_boolean_encoding`, $O_1$) and the duality frame (`pnp_duality_encoding`, $O_\infty$). The `primitiveMismatches` between them and the `ouroboricity` of each frame are machine-checkable by `decide` once `ouroboricity` is added to `Core.lean`. This is the most structurally complete P vs NP bridge certificate yet produced. Extending the bridge to Hodge and BSD remains open.

### IX.4 Formalizing the meta-barriers

The three `trivial` theorems in PvsNP.lean (BGS relativization, Razborov-Rudich natural proofs, Aaronson-Wigderson algebrization) should eventually be given genuine Lean statements. This requires formalizing oracle Turing machines, circuit complexity classes, and algebraic extension closure  --  a substantial independent Mathlib development effort.

---

## X. Conclusion (v0.1.0, 2026-03-26)

We have presented a nine-file Lean 4 library formalizing a barrier taxonomy for the seven Clay Millennium Prize Problems. The central contribution is the `BarrierType` inductive (MathlibGap / OpenProblem / MissingFoundation) and the machine-checked theorem that Yang-Mills is the unique Millennium Problem with a `MissingFoundation` barrier. We have formally distinguished stacked from parallel sorry depth, machine-verified the critical Sobolev scaling in Navier-Stokes by `norm_num`, grounded BSD in the actual Mathlib `WeierstrassCurve ℚ` infrastructure, grounded OPN in the actual Mathlib `Nat.Perfect` and `ArithmeticFunction.sigma`, and connected sorry boundaries to primitive field transitions via a machine-checked bridge file.

Subsequent updates (v0.1.1–v0.1.3) extended the primitive bridge with three structural contributions. C8 (§V.6) established a machine-checked correspondence between RH and the Lee-Yang theorem via shared `Phi_c_complex` encoding, with `lee_yang_edge` subsequently confirmed $O_\infty$ and RH identified as the requirement that zeros preserve the Frobenius $P_{\pm}^{\text{sym}}$ condition (Corollary 29.2, PRIMITIVE_THEOREMS §29). C9 (§V.7) introduced the Triad Projection Framework, reformulating RH, YM, and NS as constraint map computations over the grammar's three irreducible projections. C10 (§V.8) established that the Boolean P vs NP formulation is structurally incomplete at $O_1$, that the three classical meta-barriers are $P_\text{asym}$-frame results structurally incapable of reaching $O_\infty$, and that the duality formulation in a holographic embedding achieves the $O_\infty$-complete framework.

v0.2.0 (2026-04-14) contributes two further machine-verified results in the Primitives track. C11 (`crystal_total` and `ouroboros_successor_cycle`, §III/§64) provides the first `decide`-checked verification of the Crystal cardinality $17{,}280{,}000 = 3^3 \times 4^5 \times 5^4$ and the exponent successor cycle $\mathcal{F}_3/\mathcal{F}_4/\mathcal{F}_5$. C12 (`frobenius_not_synthesizable`, `o_inf_iff_P_pm_sym_at_phi_c`) elevates Frobenius non-synthesizability from a documented structural claim to a kernel-checked theorem: $O_\infty$ is equivalent to $\Phi_c \wedge P_{\pm}^{\text{sym}}$, and no tensor composition from sub-Frobenius partners can reach $P_{\pm}^{\text{sym}}$. This closes the loop between the barrier taxonomy and the ouroboricity tier system: `synthonTier` is now a decidable function, and every claim in §V connecting sorry boundaries to tier structure is machine-verifiable by `decide`.

The `sorry` in a Lean proof is usually treated as an obstacle to be removed. This library treats it as a datum to be classified. The three barrier types represent three distinct relationships between human mathematics and the proof assistant: what we can formalize but have not, what we have not solved, and what we have not yet defined. Formally distinguishing these is the first step toward a systematic theory of the frontier of formalized mathematics.

## Appendix II. Key Theorems

| Theorem | File | Proof | Significance |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **`ym_is_unique_missing_foundation`** | Barriers | `cases` + `simp_all` | YM uniquely lacks a foundational object |
| **`missing_foundation_vs_open_problem`** | Barriers | `decide` | Barrier types are formally distinct |
| **`ym_has_stacked_not_parallel_sorries`** | Barriers | `simp` | Stacked $\neq$ parallel at same depth |
| **`critical_scaling_gap`** | NS | `norm_num` | $0 < \frac{1}{2} < 1$ in $\mathbb{R}$ |
| **`sigma_multiplicative`** | OPN | Mathlib API | $\sigma(ab) = \sigma(a)\sigma(b)$ for coprime |
| **`ym_classical_to_quantum_cost = 4`** | PrimitiveBridge | `decide` | Quantum lift costs 4 primitive changes |
| **`ym_primitive_barrier_certificate`** | PrimitiveBridge | `rfl` + `decide` | $G_\beth \to G_\aleph$ = PathIntegralMeasure |
| **`primitive_bridge_master`** | PrimitiveBridge | `decide` + `rfl` | Four certificates simultaneously |
| **`ym_opn_barrier_distinct`** | PrimitiveBridge | `decide` | MissingFoundation $\neq$ OpenProblem at problem level |
| **`sm_qg_distance_exact = 9`** | Synthon | `decide` | SM/QG Hamming distance machine-verified |
| **`rh_leyang_o_inf_confirmed`** | PrimitiveBridge | inquiry + `rfl` | `lee_yang_edge` $O_\infty$; RH = $P_{\pm}^{\text{sym}}$ condition (C8 update) |
| **`pnp_duality_contains_boolean`** | PrimitiveBridge | `decide` | Duality frame strictly contains Boolean frame; $O_\infty$ vs $O_1$ |
| **`pnp_join_identity`** | PrimitiveBridge | `decide` | $P \vee NP = NP$ (lattice identity) |
| **`meta_barriers_in_asym_frame`** | PvsNP | `trivial` + structural note | BGS/RR/AW operate in $P_\text{asym}$ frame; cannot reach $O_\infty$ |
| **`crystal_total`** | Core | `decide` | $27 \times 1024 \times 625 = 17{,}280{,}000$ (C11) |
| **`ouroboros_successor_cycle`** | Core | `decide` | Exponent cycle $3 \to 4 \to 5 \to 3$ (C11) |
| **`frobenius_not_synthesizable`** | Core | `decide` | $P_{\pm}^{\text{sym}}$ unreachable by tensor from sub-Frobenius partners (C12) |
| **`o_inf_iff_P_pm_sym_at_phi_c`** | Synthon | `cases` + `simp` | $O_\infty \Leftrightarrow \Phi_c \wedge P_{\pm}^{\text{sym}}$ biconditional (C12) |
